            <p><p>Nine terrorists were killed and three officers including the district police officer were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906333/3-traffic-cops-injured-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat-district-police">witnessed</a> an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>Earlier, a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed said that security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.</p>
<p>“Nine terrorists killed in Hangu operation, District Police Officer Khalid Khan undergoing treatment at the Kohat Combined Military Hospital,” the statement by Kohat Regional Police Officer DIG Abbas Majeed said.</p>
<p>The operation is continuing successfully and full action is being taken against the terrorists, the statement added.</p>
<p>Hangu DPO Khan, who was injured during the operation, is undergoing surgery at the Kohat CMH. His condition is said to be satisfactory, the statement added.</p>
<p>Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi telephoned DPO Hangu and appreciated his bravery and determination.</p>
<p>“The interior minister said that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of its brave sons and is determined to achieve final victory in the war against terrorism,” the statement added.</p>
<p>“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the earlier statement by the KP IGP read.</p>
<p>“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.</p>
<p>The statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”, while his condition was said to be stable.</p>
<p>Police were making arrangements for a helicopter to airlift DPO Khalid from the Hangu hospital to Peshawar for further treatment, Imran Khan, personal secretary to IG Hameed, told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.</p>

<p>On June 21, KP police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">suicide attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924773">three</a> “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">joint operation</a> by the CTD.</p>

            <p><p>The business community in Karachi observed a partial strike on Saturday against the tax measures and arrest powers of the federal tax authority under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921249">Finance Act FY26</a>.</p>
<p>The call for a countrywide strike was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923375">issued</a> last week by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924204">backed</a> by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators. The KCCI protested against what they described as anti-business measures and proposed provincial labour policies.</p>
<p>“A partial strike was observed in Karachi on the call of industrialists and supported by traders of markets against enhancing  FBR’s powers to conduct raids and arrests of businessmen,” All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>All Karachi Tajir Ittehad is an association of markets and shopkeepers in the metropolis.</p>
<p>Mir said that the markets at Gul Plaza, Teen Talwar in Clifton and Nursery remained open. However, the majority of traders have supported the strike, though some of the traders have reservations over the nature of demands, he said.</p>
<p>“The demands of small traders were not included, particularly regarding the raids on shops and closure of shops on the pretext of being in poor condition,” he added.</p>
<p>A leader of the markets in the Old City areas, Sharjeel Goplani, told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “A partial strike was observed as Lea Market, Urdu Bazaar as well as Timber and Furniture markets remained open.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The expanded enforcement <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924164">powers</a> for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.</p>
<p>The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry had also announced its participation in the strike, condemning the enhanced powers granted to FBR officials and the lack of consultation with the private sector.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the business community appeared <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925146/business-bodies-divided-over-todays-strike-call">divided</a> over the strike with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claiming that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan.</p></p>

            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will visit the United States next week to attend high-level events of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and “certain” other engagements in Washington, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921308">assumed presidency</a> of the UNSC, marking the country’s eighth term on the 15-member body and its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Dar will visit the US to “attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as for certain engagements in Washington”, the FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiser-deputy-prime-ministerforeign-ministers-visit-to-the-united-states-to-attend-high-level-signature-events-of-pakistans-security-council-presidency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p>The statement, which did not specify the dates of Dar’s visit, mentioned at least four UNSC-affiliated events that he will attend. His expected engagements in Washington, the hub of the White House, come amid ongoing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925210/aurangzeb-eyes-game-changer-investment-discussions-with-us">trade talks</a> between the countries.</p>

<p>To express Pakistan’s “strong commitment and unwavering support” for the right to self-determination of Palestinians, Dar will also attend a <a class="link--external" href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1h/k1hflflwyv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">high-level conference</a> on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the implementation of Two-State Solution”.</p>
<p>The conference was originally planned for June but was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917074">postponed</a> due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917150">rescheduling</a> of Dar’s visit. According to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/13/macron-not-expected-to-attend-un-summit-on-two-state-solution-for-palestine-and-israel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Guardian</a></em>, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.</p>
<p>While in New York, Dar will chair a high-level <a class="link--external" href="https://docs.un.org/en/S/2025/443" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open debate</a> on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”. The debate will aim at exploring ways to strengthen multilateralism and enhance diplomacy and mediation for the peaceful settlement of disputes, the FO said.</p>
<p>In addition, the deputy premier will preside over the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s high-level participation in UNSC’s Quarterly Debate on the Middle East, as well as the global conference on the Palestine question, “is a testimony to Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to and support for the Palestinian cause”, the FO stressed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Dar will also chair a high-level UNSC briefing that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The meeting will be held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to “strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for the maintenance of international peace and security”, according to the FO.</p>
<p>During his stay in New York, Dar is also expected to have several bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials.</p>
<p>“Dar’s visit to New York and Washington exemplifies Pakistan’s growing role and importance in the multilateral arena as well as its expanding multifaceted relations with the US,” the FO highlighted.</p>
<p>On Friday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925024">met</a> with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer as part of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922229/pakistan-us-reach-accord-on-trade-and-tariffs">another</a> round of trade negotiations to avoid a 29 per cent tariff.</p>
<p>US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918093">unprecedented meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, once again <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924780/un-envoy-renews-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-gaza">called</a> for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Speaking at the UNSC’s Briefing on the Humanitarian Situation in Gaza, he called on the international community to act without delay.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pakistan had urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in conflict-battered Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and take a devastating toll on infrastructure.</p></p>

It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-administration-destroy-contraceptives-usaid-africa">Continue reading...</a></p>
