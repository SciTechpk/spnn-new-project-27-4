            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922858/govt-approves-four-potential-bidders-for-struggling-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves four potential bidders for struggling PIA</strong></a>
            <p><p>The government said on Tuesday it had approved four parties, including business groups and a military-backed firm, to potentially bid for a stake in debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines.</p>
<p>The government has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896181">seeking</a> to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.</p>
<p>It would be the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Among the bidding groups, one is a consortium of major industrial firms Lucky Cement, Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement and Metro Ventures.</p>
<p>Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fauji Fertiliser Company, a military-backed conglomerate, and Pakistani airline Airblue have been approved to bid for PIA.</p>
<p>“The pre-qualified parties will now proceed to the buy-side due diligence phase,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali said in a statement from his ministry.</p>
<p>The review process is set to last two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025, Ali previously told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The privatisation ministry also said that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved the transaction structure for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895820">Roosevelt Hotel</a> located in New York, including options for both outright sale and long-term lease.</p>
<p>From the Roosevelt Hotel, Pakistan is expecting over $100 million as a first payment during this year, Ali previously told <em>Reuters</em>.</p></p>

            <p><p>Two boys drowned in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mansehra, while the Karakoram Highway was blocked due to heavy landsliding in the Gligit-Baltistan’s Gonar farm and Mola Dad Pari area on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323">triggered</a> flash floods and landslides in various areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.</p>
<p>Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre on Monday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922678/19-killed-as-country-braces-for-more-rain">issued</a> an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to the extreme weather.</p>
<p>Mansehra Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Amir Khadam told <em>Dawn.com</em>, “An eight-year-old boy, Ibrahim, drowned in the Jabba nullah due to a sudden surge in the water flow in a dried stream.”</p>
<p>He said the search for the drowned boy continued, and Rescue 1122 teams were making efforts for it.</p>
<p>Torghar Rescue 1122 spokesperson Atiqullah Afridi said, “A young man, Mohammad Zamin, drowned in the River Indus due to an increase in the water flow of the river.”</p>
<p>He said the rescue divers were in the field and struggling to retrieve the body of the man.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Assistant Director Imtiaz Ali said that floods hit multiple areas in the Diamer region and heavy flooding was reported in Ghushay nullah, Batogah nullah, and Khinar nallah, which washed away water supply schemes and other infrastructure. However, he added that the damage from the floods was being assessed.</p>
<p>He continued that the Karakoram Highway was blocked at five different locations after flash floods brought massive debris and mud between Gilgit and Chilas of GB, suspending the traffic on both sides of the crucial route.</p>
<p>The GBDMA official said that the heavy machinery was being engaged in the road clearance work, and work was underway.
He added that no human loss was reported from anywhere in the area due to flooding.</p>
<p>Zubair Ahmad Khan, GBDMA assistant director for Hunza in Nagar region, said that it was reported that the main road leading to Hopper valley had been blocked at Supultar Nullah due to a heavy flood, accompanied by mudflow and large boulders.</p>
<p>“The flood occurred intermittently throughout the afternoon,” he said, adding, “The debris flow had now nearly stopped; however, the water level is still high, making it impossible to commence road clearance operations at this stage.”</p>
<p>He further said that the tehsildar, naib tehsildar, and Communication and Works (C&amp;W) Department sub-engineer are present on-site, and the GBDMA excavator is available at the location.</p>
<p>“Restoration and clearance work will start tomorrow morning, subject to further improvement in water conditions,” he added.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan ordered relevant departments to remain alert in view of flood situation, according to a statement by his office.</p>
<p>“Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all relevant departments including the GBDMA and district administrations to remain alert in view of the flood situation in different areas due to melting of glaciers and rise in river levels due to increase in heat intensity,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Deputy commissioners and relevant officers should take timely steps to prevent losses due to floods, Khan said, adding that departments should utilise all resources to initiate the timely rescue and rehabilitation process in any emergency situation.</p>
<p>On Sunday, six people were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498">killed</a> while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and KP, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) in both the provinces.</p>
<p>More than 22 people were killed and 11 others were injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920723">wreaked havoc</a> in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/trump-faces-maga-meltdown-over-epstein-reversal-after-govt-says-sex-offender-did-not-have-client-list' target='_blank'><strong>Trump faces MAGA meltdown over Epstein reversal after govt says sex offender did not have ‘client list’</strong></a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base is up in arms after his administration effectively shut down conspiracy theories related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that had become an obsession for the US president’s diehard supporters.</p>
<p>Trump’s Justice Department and the FBI said in a memo made public on Sunday that there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful figures.</p>
<p>They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1499139">death by suicide</a>, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.</p>
<p>It marked the first time Trump’s officials had publicly scotched the stories, pushed by numerous right-wing figures, notably including the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) top two officials, before Trump hired them.</p>
<p>The backlash was swift and brutal from his “Make America Great Again” movement — who have long held as an article of faith that “Deep State” elites were protecting Epstein’s most powerful associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood.</p>
<p>“Next the Department of Justice will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,’” furious pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tweeted. “This is over the top sickening.”</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump has managed to avoid much of the direct blame over the fiasco, with ire instead being directed at FBI director Kash Patel, his deputy Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>
<p>Bongino and Patel spent years pushing conspiracy theories around the so-called “Epstein list”.</p>
<p>The controversy has clearly rattled Trump, who defended Bongino and Patel on social media as the “greatest law enforcement professionals in the world”, without explaining why he had spoken out.</p>

<p>Bongino reposted Trump’s praise and was deluged with furious responses.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>But the lion’s share of the fury has been reserved for Bondi, who assured <em>Fox News</em> in February she had the Epstein client list on her desk and would get to the truth — in remarks endorsed by the White House.</p>
<p>Bondi was already on thin ice with MAGA after distributing binders labelled “The Epstein Files” to influencers at the White House that turned out to contain largely already public information and no new revelations.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#embarrassment" id="embarrassment" title="Permalink"></a>‘Embarrassment’</h2>
<p>“President Trump should fire [Bondi] for lying to his base and creating a liability for his administration,” far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted on X.</p>
<p>“She is an embarrassment and she doesn’t do anything to help Trump.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--twitter  "><span>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed about the controversy and said that Bondi was actually talking about Epstein-related paperwork as a whole, sparking even more MAGA fury.</p>
<p>“This is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very ‘Deep State’ you have spent years attacking,” <em>CNN</em> analyst Chris Cillizza <a class="link--external" href="https://chriscillizza.substack.com/p/what-happens-when-the-leopards-eat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Substack newsletter.</p>
<p>Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1492768/us-financier-epstein-arrested-on-sex-charges">charged</a> with sex trafficking.
Trump — who has denied visiting the US Virgin Islands home where prosecutors say Epstein sex trafficked underage girls — said ahead of his election he would have “no problem” releasing files related to the case.</p>
<p>It is one of a number of schisms that have opened in the MAGA movement in recent days, with supporters angry over Trump’s announcement that weapons supplies to Ukraine would resume.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trump’s fiercely isolationist base was already upset at the president’s bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites and his statements calling for an easing of immigration raids on farms.</p>
<p>Beyond its insights into the power dynamics that animate Trump’s supporters, the affair has raised concerns that MAGA disillusionment will damage Republican prospects in the next election cycle.</p>
<p>The row comes with Trump under pressure from the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922467/elon-musk-says-he-has-created-a-new-us-political-party">launch of a new political party</a> by his estranged former close aide Elon Musk, who had a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915756">bitter public split</a> with the president over federal spending.</p>
<p>When the Trump-Musk feud blew up last month, Musk <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916501">alleged that Trump was named</a> in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.</p>
<p>Trump was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1803347/two-former-us-presidents-named-in-epstein-files">named</a> in a trove of depositions and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024, but the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Supporters on the conspiratorial end of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base allege that Epstein’s associates had their roles in his crimes covered up by government officials and others.</p>
<p>They point the finger at Democrats and Hollywood celebrities, although not at Trump himself.</p>
<p>“What’s the time?” the world’s richest man posted on his social media platform X on Monday, alongside an image of an Epstein countdown clock.</p>
<p>“Oh look, it’s no-one-has-been-arrested-o’clock again! “</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#exhaustive-review" id="exhaustive-review" title="Permalink"></a>‘Exhaustive review’</h2>
<p>The DOJ and FBI’s conclusions came after an “exhaustive review” of the evidence amassed against Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking, the agencies said in a joint memorandum.</p>
<p>Six years later, questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s life and death and the multi-millionaire hedge fund manager’s connections to wealthy and powerful individuals.</p>
<p>The memo, first reported by <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-client-list-trump-administration" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a></em>, squarely rejected one of the leading conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein — that he did not commit suicide but was murdered while being held in jail.</p>
<p>“After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell,” it said.</p>
<p>Video footage from the area where he was being held did not show anyone entering or attempting to enter his cell from the time at night when he was locked in till when his body was found the next morning, it said.</p>
<p>Extensive digital and physical searches turned up a large volume of images and videos of Epstein’s victims, many of them underage girls, the memo said.</p>
<p>“This review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one thousand victims,” it said, but did not reveal any illegal wrongdoing by “third parties”.</p>
<p>“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”</p>
<p>Epstein’s former assistant, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the only former associate of his who has been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1683183">criminally charged</a> in connection with his activities.</p>
<p>Maxwell, the daughter of British media baron Robert Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in New York in 2021 of child sex trafficking and other crimes.</p>
<p>Among those with connections to Epstein was Britain’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1518041/britains-prince-andrew-halts-public-duties-over-sex-scandal">Prince Andrew</a>, who settled a US civil case in February 2022 brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed he sexually assaulted her when she was 17.</p>
<p>Giuffre, who accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave, died by suicide at her home in Australia in April.</p></p>
