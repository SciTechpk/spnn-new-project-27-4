            <p><p>The Lahore police on Tuesday said it detained more than 30 PTI activists after they took to the streets to officially kick off a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928760/pti-to-kick-off-free-imran-movement-today">nationwide movement</a> for the release of ex-premier Imran Khan, who has been in jail for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">two years</a> now.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">Aug 5, 2023</a> in a case related to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1873672/ihc-grants-imran-bail-in-new-toshakhana-case-as-govt-rules-out-release">state gifts</a>, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending trials</a> in alleged terrorism cases related to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023 riots</a>.</p>
<p>Imran had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952">issued</a> a nationwide protest call, with a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIofficial/status/1952386498889683368" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> attributed to him saying that the “movement that begins on August 5 will continue until democracy is restored in its true spirit”. According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 was the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a “final call”.</p>
<p>Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told <em>Dawn.com</em>: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.”</p>
<p>He denied <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-police-arrest-120-workers-ex-pm-imran-khans-party-ahead-protest-2025-08-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> of the police arresting hundreds of activists.</p>
<p>At around 1pm, the PTI claimed that one of its leaders, Rehana Dar, had been detained by the police in Lahore.</p>
<p>“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said on its official X account.</p>
<p>It shared a video showing Dar, who <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1816570">contested</a> the 2024 general elections in Sialkot against PML-N’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, being dragged into a police van by personnel with riot gear.</p>
<p>The PTI said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar “have sunk to a new low with this act” and “abandoned all sense of shame and decency”.</p>

<p><em>Reuters</em> pictures also showed at least four other individuals being detained in Lahore.</p>
<p>Raja Shahbaz Bhatti, president of the PTI’s Insaf Youth Wing in north Punjab, <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/shahbazrajapti/status/1952641724808929384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> on X that he was injured due to police action and that <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/shahbazrajapti/status/1952645268605632772" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four others</a> were arrested.</p>
<p>The PTI in Bahawalpur claimed on X that “several” of its workers who had gathered in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest were arrested.</p>
<p>Purported pictures of the incident shared by the party showed workers making a victory pose as they entered a police van, with cops equipped with batons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned, the party <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIKPOfficial/status/1952670976140800073" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at 3pm.</p>
<p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur is expected to attend a rally in Peshawar, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTIKPOfficial/status/1952603502284267954" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a> showing a container for that gathering.</p>

<p>Umar, a former finance minister, said on X: “Even two years after Imran Khan’s imprisonment, the anti-Khan narrative did not sell, and the public believes that Khan is imprisoned on political grounds, not legal ones.</p>
<p>“Do not waste more time; the entire national leadership should sit with the PTI and carve out a solution in accordance with the Constitution,” he suggested, adding that there was no other way to end the ongoing political crisis.</p>

            <p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif assured the National Assembly on Tuesday that the government was taking measures for Arbaeen pilgrims following an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">overland travel ban</a>, saying the Balochistan government had been directed to operate direct flights from Quetta to Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>Every year, Shia Muslims from Pakistan travel by land route to Karbala in Iraq via Iran to take part in Arbaeen rituals during the Islamic month of Safar. Arbaeen marks the end of a 40-day mourning period following Ashura, the anniversary of Imam Hussain’s martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala.</p>
<p>Late last month, the government announced that Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) would be <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927007">barred</a> from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for Arbaeen due to security concerns.  The decision immediately drew flak from the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927487">Sindh government</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927719">senators</a>, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927338/pti-raps-overland-travel-ban-on-arbaeen-pilgrims">PTI</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927195">PPP</a>, while Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926827">advised</a> pilgrims to secure an e-visa for the pilgrimage by August 7.</p>
<p>Speaking in the NA today, the defence minister acknowledged that the ban was enforced due to serious security concerns, particularly because of the threat of terrorist attacks targeting pilgrim convoys.</p>

<p>“To mitigate these risks, the federal government has authorised the Balochistan government to operate direct flights from Quetta, allowing pilgrims to safely travel by air to their destinations,” he said.</p>
<p>“Iran has so far allowed one such flight; we are pressing them to start frequent flight operations as well.”</p>
<p>Arrangements had also been made for onward transportation of pilgrims from airports in Iran and Iraq to their intended sites, he said.</p>
<p>“Advertisements had been published over the past four days inviting private carriers to operate on the route, and all licensed private airlines had been allowed to provide services,” he told the NA.</p>
<p>“Chartered flights have also been approved to maximise the number of pilgrims able to travel safely.”</p>
<p>He urged potential operators and the market to take full advantage of the permissions granted, while acknowledging that these measures were aimed at offering maximum facilities while avoiding the security hazards of road travel.</p>
<p>Asif further said that the matter was discussed during the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928404">visit</a> of the Iranian president to Pakistan, adding that Iran had allowed an additional flight to facilitate the movement of Pakistani pilgrims.</p>
<p>“I want to assure the House and the people across Pakistan that the government is fully committed to ensuring safe, comfortable, and timely transportation for all Arbaeen pilgrims,” he said.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral Naveed Ashraf was conferred Turkiye’s highest military award — titled Legion of Merit of the Turkish Armed Forces — for his efforts towards “defence and maritime cooperation” between the two nations, the Pakistan Navy said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pakistani armed forces routinely conduct joint military exercises with other nations to increase combat readiness and identify problems in logistics, training, and current military doctrine.</p>
<p>Pakistan Navy, in its statement, said the commander of Turkish Navy, Admiral Ercument Tatlioglu, “presented [the] award to Adm Naveed Ashraf in recognition of his efforts to strengthen defence &amp; maritime coop b/w the two countries”.</p>

<p>The award ceremony was held at the headquarters of the Turkish Naval Forces, where he was also given a guard of honour.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s naval chief called upon Turkiye’s Defence Minister Yasar Guler, Chief of General Staff Metin Gurak, and the Commander of the Turkish Navy Fleet, Admiral Kadir Yildiz.</p>
<p>The two sides discussed collaborative avenues between Pakistan and Turkiye’s navies, mainly “regional maritime security, defence cooperation,” and increased interaction via “joint exercises, mutual visits, training and exchange programmes”.</p>
<p>The CNS visited the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, where he was briefed on the Pakistan Navy’s Milgem project.</p>
<p>Pakistan Navy <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640911">signed</a> the contract for four Milgem class corvettes with Turkiye in 2018.</p>
<p>Under the contract, two ships are to be constructed at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard and the other two at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works.</p>
<p>The naval chief also observed submarine construction at Golchuk Naval Base. Following this, he visited Turkish naval ships, including “TCG Oruçreis, S/M PIRIREIS and NDU”, the statement said.</p>
<p>The naval chief paid his respect to Turkiye’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, by laying a wreath at his mausoleum.</p>
<p>On July 10, a delegation led by Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Güler called on  Pakistan Air Force Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, where both sides agreed on the establishment of dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest.</p></p>
