                <h2>FO slams Indian parliament debate on ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô for distorting facts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday assailed and rejected the Indian parliament‚Äôs debate on ‚ÄúOperation Sindoor‚Äù, claiming that the remarks made in the Lok Sabha ‚Äúdistort facts, justify aggression, and glorify conflict for domestic consumption‚Äù.</p>
<p>The two countries entered a brief but intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military escalation</a> after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On May 6‚Äì7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> ended the war.</p>
<p>During Tuesday‚Äôs debate, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927416">claimed</a> that security forces killed three ‚ÄúPakistanis‚Äù involved in the Pahalgam attack in Operation Mahadev, <em>Reuters</em> reported. ‚ÄúI want to tell ‚Ä¶ the entire nation that these were the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927163#:~:text=Indian%20army%20says%20three%20suspected%20fighters%20killed%20in%20held-Kashmir">three terrorists</a> who killed our citizens ‚Ä¶ and now all three have been killed,‚Äù Shah told parliament during the discussion.</p>
<p>In a statement issued today on the Indian parliament debate, FO spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan said: ‚ÄúPakistan categorically rejects the baseless assertions and provocative claims made by the Indian leaders during the Lok Sabha debate on the so-called ‚ÄòOperation Sindoor‚Äô. These statements reflect a dangerous tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and glorify conflict for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe world knows that India attacked Pakistan without any verifiable evidence or a credible investigation into the Pahalgam Attack. During the intervening night of May 6 and 7, 2025, India‚Äôs targeting of the alleged terrorist infrastructure resulted actually in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children. India failed to achieve any of its strategic objectives. On the other hand, Pakistan‚Äôs resounding success in neutralising the Indian fighter jets and military targets is an indisputable fact.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that ‚Äúinstead of misleading their compatriots, the Indian leaders would be well-advised to acknowledge the losses incurred by their armed forces and accept the active role played by the third parties in realising the ceasefire‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson said that India had not used the immediate offer made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for a transparent and independent probe into the Pahalgam Attack but had instead chosen the ‚Äúpath of belligerence and aggression‚Äù.</p>
<p>He further added that India had ‚Äúacted as a judge, jury and executioner at the same time‚Äù and thus in the backdrop of all this, ‚Äúany claims regarding the so-called ‚ÄòOperation Mahadev‚Äô do not hold any significance for us‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe account given by the Indian home minister is replete with fabrications, leading to serious questions about its credibility. Is it a mere coincidence that the alleged perpetrators of the Pahalgam Attack were killed at the start of the Lok Sabha debate?‚Äù</p>

<p>The FO statement also criticised the Indian government for its statements about establishing a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911476">new normal</a>‚Äù in bilateral relations through the strikes and rubbished New Delhi‚Äôs narrative of ‚Äúnuclear blackmail‚Äù on the part of Pakistan, calling such claims ‚Äúa misleading and self-serving construct‚Äù that were ‚Äúan attempt to veil its own escalatory impulses while shifting blame onto Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor us, the only ‚Äònormal‚Äô in bilateral relations is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and adherence to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter,‚Äù the statement read.</p>

<p>The FO said it was ‚Äúwell known that Pakistan deterred India through its conventional capabilities, affirming that discipline and restraint remain its guiding principles‚Äù.</p>
<p>The FO spokesperson also once again expressed disapproval of the ‚Äúmisplaced assertions‚Äù by the Indian leadership regarding the Indus Waters Treaty. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs decision to hold the treaty in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">abeyance</a> shows its blatant disregard for the sanctity of international treaties, and strikes at a fundamental pillar of regional cooperation,‚Äù the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>He added that India should adhere to the terms of the agreement rather than ‚Äútaking pride in a unilateral and illegal move‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs continued reliance on disinformation, jingoism, and chest-thumping risks destabilising South Asia,‚Äù the FO stated, reiterating that Pakistan was a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù nation and reaffirming its commitment to ‚Äúpeace, regional stability and a meaningful dialogue for resolution of all outstanding issues‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Trump says India to pay 25pc tariff from Aug 1 with additional penalty for Russian energy purchases</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that a 25 per cent trade tariff would be imposed on India from August 1 along with an additional penalty for Russian energy purchases amid the Ukraine War.</p>
<p>In posts on his social platform Truth Social, he said the US had a ‚Äúmassive trade deficit‚Äù with India.</p>

<p>In another <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114942106248731470" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>, he said: ‚ÄúRemember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlso, they have always bought a vast majority of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914970/indian-defence-chief-admitting-pakistan-downed-jets-may-be-veiled-criticism-of-modis-policies-expert#:~:te%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dystem">military equipment</a> from Russia, and are Russia‚Äôs largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine ‚Äî all things not good! India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1st.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-full  w-full  media--stretch    media--uneven  media--stretch">

    </figure></p>
<p>Earlier, he said a trade deal with India had yet to be finalised and warned of possible higher tariffs ahead of an August 1 deadline to seal an agreement.</p>
<p>His comments followed a <em>Reuters</em> report that India was preparing to accept <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900156">higher</a> tariffs of 20-25pc on its exports to the US in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901301">absence</a> of a trade deal, as it holds off on offering fresh concessions ahead of Friday‚Äôs deadline.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia has been a good friend, but India has charged basically <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896546">more</a> tariffs, almost more than any other country,‚Äù Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, adding that it would come to an end.</p>
<p>Asked about the <em>Reuters</em> report, Trump said a trade deal had not been finalised and India could face steeper tariffs.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>India plans to resume broader trade talks with the US in mid-August when a US delegation is due to visit, hoping to seal a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement by October, Indian officials said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTalks are progressing well,‚Äù an official said, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a ‚Äúworst-case scenario‚Äù. The official declined to be identified without authorisation to speak to the media.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut, we assume it would be (a) temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,‚Äù the official said.</p>
<p>Trump also reiterated his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">claim</a> that he helped broker a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict</a> between India and Pakistan earlier this year, saying both sides accepted his request.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat was great,‚Äù he said describing his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891744">friendship</a> with India‚Äôs Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534">disputes</a> Trump‚Äôs claims that he brokered the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Analysts say Trump‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">remarks</a> on the India-Pakistan conflict have cast a shadow on trade negotiations.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1901810/trumps-tariffs-stoke-global-trade-war-as-china-eu-hit-back">tariff</a> he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new ‚Äúworld tariff‚Äù rate.</p>
<p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/28/china-trade-talks-trump-greer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNBC</em></a> that the India talks require more time, noting Trump wants good deals, not fast ones.</p>
<p>India has shown ‚Äústrong interest in opening portions of its market‚Äù though its trade policy had long focused on protecting domestic interests, Greer said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs trade minister, told <em>Reuters</em> last week India was making ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù progress in US trade talks.</p>
<p>Indian officials said New Delhi had offered tariff cuts on a wide range of goods and was working to ease non-tariff barriers.</p>
<p>However, agriculture and dairy remain no-go areas, with India unwilling to allow US imports of genetically modified soybean or corn, or to open its dairy sector.</p>
<p>Total bilateral goods trade <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882868">reached</a> about $129 billion in 2024, with India posting a surplus of nearly $46bn.</p>
<p>Officials said India was calibrating its strategy amid broader US tariff threats targeting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922519/brics-nations-slam-trump-tariffs-condemn-strikes-on-iran">Brics</a> nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others), including India, over issues such as de-dollarisation and Russian oil purchases.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe remain hopeful of securing a deal that gives Indian exporters preferential access compared to our peers,‚Äù a second Indian government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p></p>
