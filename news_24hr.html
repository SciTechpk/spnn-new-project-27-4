            <p><p>Saudi Arabia on Tuesday promised billions of dollars in deals with the United States, from defence to artificial intelligence, as it threw a lavish welcome for President Donald Trump on the first state <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555">visit</a> of his second term.</p>
<p>The Saudis escorted Air Force One into the kingdom with fighter jets before bringing out long-stretching guards of honour and sending flag-waving cavalry to accompany Trump’s motorcade to the palace.</p>
<p>Under imposing chandeliers, Trump welcomed a promise by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for $600 billion in investment and quipped that it should be $1 trillion.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>“We have the biggest business leaders in the world here today, and they’re going to walk away with a lot of cheques,” Trump told the prince.</p>
<p>For “the United States, it’s probably two million jobs that we’re talking about”, Trump said.</p>
<p>The White House said that Saudi Arabia would buy nearly $142bn in weapons in what it described as the largest-ever weapons deal, although Trump in his first term trumpeted a larger, longer-term figure.</p>
<p>The White House said that Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20bn in artificial intelligence-related sites in the United States, while tech firms including Google will invest in both countries — welcome news for Saudi Arabia, which has long faced restrictions in US advanced technology.</p>
<p>With cameras rolling, a lengthy procession of Saudi royalty and business figures waited their turn to shake hands with Trump and the crown prince, including Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a close adviser to Trump, who made a rare appearance in a suit.</p>

<p>The US leader will head later in the week to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, fellow oil-rich Arab monarchies with long-standing ties to the United States — and to Trump.</p>
<p>In choosing the Gulf for his first major tour, the 78-year-old billionaire is again bypassing traditional presidential stops among Western allies, some of which have been unnerved by his norms-shattering diplomacy.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, Trump also chose Saudi Arabia for his first overseas trip, when he posed with a glowing orb and participated in a sword dance.</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#saudis-seek-image-change" id="saudis-seek-image-change" title="Permalink"></a>Saudis seek image change</h2>
<p>Trump’s embrace of the Saudis contrasts with a more hesitant initial approach by former president Joe Biden, who had vowed to punish the crown prince after US intelligence found that he <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1440201">ordered</a> the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.</p>
<p>Trump reminisced with the 39-year-old crown prince over their first meeting, saying he was “so impressed with this young guy who was very wise beyond his years”.</p>
<p>Since Khashoggi’s gruesome killing, Saudi Arabia has worked aggressively to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1693033">change its image</a>, from easing restrictions on women to diversifying from oil to new areas such as artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The country has also increasingly exercised diplomatic clout, serving as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900110">venue</a> for the United States to pursue talks with Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have also sought outsized international roles, with the Qataris serving as a mediator along with the United States and Egypt in the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>Jon Alterman, senior vice president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said that for Trump, the Gulf “is his happy place”.</p>
<p>The leaders will “flatter him and not criticise him. And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners”, he said.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#israel-and-trump-at-odds-over-iran-nuclear-strategy" id="israel-and-trump-at-odds-over-iran-nuclear-strategy" title="Permalink"></a>Israel and Trump at odds over Iran nuclear strategy</h2>
<p>Israel is threatening military action against Iran while US President Donald Trump pursues diplomacy, exposing a growing rift between the long-time allies over how to confront the Islamic Republic’s advancing nuclear programme.</p>
<p>As a fourth round of indirect talks between Iran and the US kicked off in Muscat on Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar emphasised that his country would not allow Tehran, under any circumstances, to develop its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” said Saar.</p>
<p>Like Western countries, Israel suspects its arch foe Iran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Tehran denies these allegations, defending its right to civilian nuclear energy.</p>
<p>“If military operations are necessary […] so be it,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in an interview published this week by the German newspaper <em>Die Welt</em>, while also stating that he wanted to give “dialogue a chance”.</p>
<p>In 2015, Iran and several major powers signed an agreement regulating Tehran’s nuclear development, including uranium enrichment, in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the country since the mid-2000s.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#military-option" id="military-option" title="Permalink"></a>Military option</h2>
<p>However, in 2018, the United States, during Trump’s first term, withdrew from the agreement, rendering the deal largely ineffective.</p>
<p>Since then, Iran has resumed much of its nuclear activities.</p>
<p>The country is now enriching uranium up to 60 per cent, well above the 3.67pc limit set by the agreement, but still below the 90pc threshold required for making nuclear weapons, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>Since his return to the White House, Trump has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906530">initiated</a> new negotiations, which Israel opposes.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have also expressed irritation at another agreement made behind their backs between Washington and Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p>
<p>“Israel insists that the [nuclear] agreement be much more comprehensive [than the one in 2015] and that Iran not be allowed to domestically enrich uranium,” geopolitical analyst Michael Horowitz told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>According to him, Israeli authorities now believe that “Tehran can quickly develop a weapon if it chooses to.”</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who applauded Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has emphasised that Israel is prepared to use all means necessary to stop the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capacity.</p>
<p>“The deal that truly works is the one that eliminates Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons,” he said in late April, urging for the complete “dismantling” of the nuclear programme.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#awkward-position" id="awkward-position" title="Permalink"></a>‘Awkward position’</h2>
<p>“There are currently many voices in Israel suggesting that there is a window of opportunity to use military force if necessary,” said Raz Zimmt, director of Iran studies at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>According to him, the idea of strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure is motivated by two factors.</p>
<p>The first being the perception that Iran has been weakened after Israel targeted its defence systems in October 2024.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact that Hezbollah is also diminished after its conflict with Israel in 2024, and thus “incapable of retaliating” to defend Tehran, its major ally.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by <em>AFP</em> say that if Israel were to strike Iranian nuclear sites, the United States would likely be expected — at the very least — to be ready to defend Israel in the event of Iranian retaliation.</p>
<p>“A strike with the support or even participation of Washington can be much more effective,” said Horowitz.</p>
<p>“Trump’s positions are putting Israel in an awkward position: he (Netanyahu) doesn’t want to be at odds with the new administration, but he is beginning to understand that Trump wants a deal at all costs.”</p>
<p>Zimmt says, however, that “it is highly unlikely that Netanyahu would oppose Trump” if the latter signed an agreement with Iran.</p></p>

            <p><p>In a rare public appearance, former prime minister Imran Khan’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — called attention to their father’s incarceration.</p>
<p>Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831/legal-woes-deepen-as-imran-and-bushra-convicted-in-ps190m-al-qadir-trust-case">£190 million corruption case</a> and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>This is the first time the two have publicly talked about their father’s incarceration. They were allowed by a court in November 2023 to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1786207">contact him</a> every week, but these talks, according to them, have not always been facilitated.</p>
<p>In an interview with X influencer Mario Nawfal on why they chose to speak out now, Qasim said: “We’ve gone through the legal routes. We’ve gone through every route that we thought would potentially get him out. We never thought he would be in there a fraction of how long he’s been in there. And it’s only getting worse. And, so, we’ve somewhat run out of those options. And now we’ve decided the only route of taking action is to come and speak publicly.”</p>
<p>He added: “What we want is international pressure on Pakistan right now, because currently he’s living in inhumane conditions. They’re not giving him basic human rights … They’re not really doing anywhere near enough. And what we want is global pressure.”</p>
<p>On the topic of a lack of success so far through legal channels, Suleman said: “We’ve exhausted other options [and] legal avenues and it’s gone very quiet. It seems, in the international media, it seems to have gone very quiet.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>The PTI has frequently complained about Imran’s facilities and has filed several petitions in the Islamabad High Court regarding the issue. On the other hand, the jail administration has refuted the claims.</p>
<p>Questioned about the calls by US official <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881184">Richard Grenell</a> for their father’s release, Suleman said the two had not had any contact with him so far but were grateful for “all the support he’s shown”.</p>
<p>Regarding a message they had for the Trump administration on the topic, Suleman said: “We’d call for any government that supports free speech and proper democracy to join the call for our father’s release.”</p>
<p>Qasim similarly said he wanted the international community to “look at what’s going and hopefully take action and who better than Trump to gain the attention of.</p>
<p>“We’d love to speak to Trump or try and figure out a way where he would be able to help out in some way. Because, at the end of the day, all we’re trying to do is free our father, bring democracy in Pakistan and just ensure his basic human rights.”</p>
<p>Talking about the toll the situation had had on them, Qasim said “it’s been pretty brutal”.</p>
<p>The brothers claimed their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”</p>
<p>They further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.</p>
<p>The brothers said they did not want to participate in politics, adding that they had taken permission from Imran before speaking out in the interview.</p>
<p>The two have stayed away from the limelight, with their mother, British journalist and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith, stressing that her sons had nothing to do with Pakistani politics.</p>
<p>In 2022, after anti-PTI protests were held outside her UK residence, she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/jemima_khan/status/1514905712148860929" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on the former Twitter platform, “[…] I have got nothing to do with Pakistani politics and neither have my children. They are low-key private individuals who are not even on social media.”</p>
<p>The following year, Jemima expressed her disappointment with X owner Elon Musk for taking away the previous blue-tick verification from accounts after trolls made fake accounts of her sons.</p>
<p>“Fake accounts pretending to be my children, created by imposters with a political agenda in Pakistan. This is exactly what I feared would happen when you took away Twitter’s verification blue ticks. FYI my children are not on social media &amp; have no plans to be,” she <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/Jemima_Khan/status/1659311882367279106" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910779/junaid-akbar-submits-resignation-as-pac-chairman-to-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Junaid Akbar submits resignation as PAC chairman to PTI</strong></a>
            <p><p>PTI MNA Junaid Akbar on Tuesday said he had handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party.</p>
<p>The development came after it emerged that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910714">to resign</a> from the position and focus on provincial matters.</p>
<p>In a video statement issued today, Akbar confirmed that he had handed over his resignation to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that he readily accepted the decision of the party and Imran.</p>
<p>“Whatever the decision of the party and the decision of Imran Khan, I will not think for a moment and will readily accept it,” he said.</p>
<p>Akbar said the position was a responsibility given by the party and he would accept any decision by the PTI founder, including handing over the party presidency or resignation from the assembly.</p>
<p>PTI’s central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, had confirmed to <em>Dawn</em>, that Akbar would step down as PAC chairman. He said Imran had conveyed the message through his sister Aleema Khan during their last meeting and announced that Akbar would be replaced by Omar Ayub Khan. He said Aleema conveyed the message to Salman Akram Raja after coming out of Adiala Jail.</p>
<p>Akbar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887487">elected unopposed</a> as chairman of the PAC in January this year. In the same month, he was appointed by Imran as the president of PTI’s KP chapter, replacing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.</p>
<p>The position had been vacant since the February 2024 general elections, which brought the PML-N government to power. The PAC chairmanship is usually held by the leader of the opposition or their nominee, though there is no legal requirement for this parliamentary tradition.</p>
<p>After the general elections, the PTI made several U-turns over nominating a candidate for the post of PAC chairman. Sher Afzal Marwat was initially nominated, followed by the names of Akram and Omar. Ultimately, Akbar’s name was finalised for the post.</p></p>
