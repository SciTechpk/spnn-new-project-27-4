                <h2>China appreciates Pakistan‚Äôs role for regional peace in meeting with COAS Munir: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>China acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs role in regional peace during a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, the military‚Äôs media affairs wing said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity.</p>
<p>Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879166">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>During his official visit to the People‚Äôs Republic of China, the army chief held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan‚Äôs pivotal role in promoting regional peace,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDiscussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoth sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.‚Äù</p>
<p>The statement continued that the ‚ÄúChinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia‚Äù.</p>

<p>The military engagement between both sides included ‚Äúcomprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages‚Äù, ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, ‚ÄúUpon arrival at the  People‚Äôs Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.‚Äù</p>
<p>The COAS appreciated China‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent support‚Äù and reaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äúfurther expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains‚Äù, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>The statement said that the visit ‚Äúreflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements‚Äù.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a ‚Äúmajor transformation‚Äù in the shipping sector.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with Chinese foreign minister, where both sides <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p></p>

                <h2>At least 9 dead as floods, landslides continue to ravage GB: officials</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>At least nine people have died as floods and landslides triggered by heavy rain continue to wreak havoc on Gilgit Baltistan, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> through GB‚Äôs Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods">issued</a> a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region ‚Äî including two women and two children ‚Äî while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.</p>
<p>In his statement, he estimated that the ‚Äúnumber of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.‚Äù On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,‚Äù he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.</p>
<p>Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, ‚ÄúIn total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.‚Äù</p>

<p>He went on to say: ‚ÄúA total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.‚Äù</p>
<p>Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEfforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,‚Äù Faraq said in his statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success‚Äù, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi‚Äôs Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.</p>
<p>The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.</p>
<p>Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p></p>
