            <p><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday said that the government was focused on developing a “strategic” federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026.</p>
<p>Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912130">opened</a> high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912931/budget-put-off-to-june-10-as-talks-with-imf-continue">postponed</a> the budget announcement till June 10.</p>
<p>While speaking at an event in Islamabad, the finance minister said they were working on a “strategic budget” instead of “just making the math work”.</p>
<p>He said that the “DNA” of the economy had to change.</p>
<p>“And therefore we are going to bring some bold measures during the budget because the budget is not just about revenue and expenditure but has to provide the strategic direction where the economy is and where it is heading,” he said.</p>
<p>“So it’s our full effort to make this document more strategic, rather than just making the math work,” he said. “Of course, we have to make the math work.”</p>
<p>On debt servicing cost, he noted that it had gone down “by a trillion rupees”.</p>
<p>“And next year, what we are going to do, god willing, is to restructure and reorganise our debt management office along modern lines in terms of international best practices,” he said.</p>
<p>He observed that the country was heavily dependent on imports, leading to a foreign exchange issue and a balance of payment crisis.</p>
<p>“We go running back to the lenders as the last resort, the reason why we are in the 24th IMF programme … let’s be very clear about this because all of us have had enough boom and bust cycles,” he added.</p>
<p>In terms of structural reforms, he reiterated the government’s resolve to “stay the course” on the taxation side; people, process, and technology framework; and digitalisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).</p>
<p>On the public financing side, the finance minister said, “Its important that whatever we are doing — including the rightsizing of the federal government — we are taking it in waves rather than a big bang approach and we will continue on that journey.”</p>

<p>Last year, Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, had said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.</p></p>

            <p><p>In another incident amid a growing crackdown on alleged espionage, Indian authorities on Monday said they arrested a paramilitary police officer on charges of “spying for Pakistan” following a recent military confrontation between the two neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>The developments follow a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.  On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a>.

<p>Last week, Indian police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911773">arrested 10 people</a> in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation.</p>
<p>On Monday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) alleged a Central Reserve Police Force officer was arrested in Delhi “for sharing sensitive information with Pakistani agents”.</p>
<p>“The accused, Moti Ram Jat, was actively involved in espionage activity and had been sharing classified information related to national security with Pakistan Intelligence Officers (PIOs) since 2023,” the NIA alleged.</p>
<p>Jat has been remanded to custody until June 6 by a special court, the agency said, as investigators question him.</p>
<p>The spate of arrests comes after the worst flare-up in violence between the nuclear-armed rivals since their last open conflict in 1999.</p>
<p>Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi last week for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed “<a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193612/the-weaponisation-of-feminism-in-operation-sindoor">Operation Sindoor</a>”.</p>
<p>The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to <em><a class="link--external" href="https://scroll.in/latest/1082481/ashoka-university-professor-arrested-for-remarks-about-operation-sindoor-press-briefings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scroll</a></em>.</p>
<p>Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/AliMahmudabad/posts/pfbid02xyWKawdrezZSxoS4wZCRgDAzA8S7zmCjhsTZW2K2MreyPyLmLRFFDJf1nF9yvfnGl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social media post</a> on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights <a class="link--external" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/kashmir-kashmiris-and-the-politics-of-retribution-101748094024385.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that between April 27 and May 8, there were 184 anti-Muslim attacks of various sorts all over India.</p>
<p>They comprise 19 acts of vandalism, 39 assaults, 42 incidents of harassment and 84 incidents of hate speech. It’s believed that 106 were “triggered” by Pahalgam. The majority happened in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra.</p></p>
