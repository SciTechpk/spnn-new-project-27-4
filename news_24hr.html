            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926046/mostly-children-among-13-dead-in-kp-monsoon-spell-over-last-48-hours-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Mostly children among 13 dead in KP monsoon spell over last 48 hours: PDMA</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 13 people died, including nine children, and three were injured over the last 48 hours in monsoon rain-related incidents across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) said in a damage report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.</p>
<p>The monsoon death toll since the end of June <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">surged</a> to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.</p>
<p>Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. “The dead body has been recovered by the locals,” the PDMA said.</p>
<p>Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925908#:~:text=In%20Bajaur%20tribal%20district%2C%20two%20brothers%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away%20by%20downpour%2Dinduced%20floods%20in%20the%20Lowi%20Mamund%20tehsil.">victims</a> were brothers, aged 21 and five.</p>
<p>“Their mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,” the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner’s Office as saying.</p>
<p>Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.</p>
<p>“The current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,” the report said.</p>
<p>“The PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,” it said.</p>
<p>The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.</p>
<p>“The public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,” the report added.</p>
<p>On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925684/cm-orders-officials-to-remain-vigilant-as-more-rains-forecast">directed</a> the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.</p>
<p>He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829">warned</a> of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.</p>

<p>All tourists who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20250%20tourists%20and%20passengers%20stranded%20at%20the%20Babusar%20Highway%20have%20been%20rescued%20by%20the%20Diamer%20district%20administration%2C%20volunteers%2C%20police%2C%20Rescue%201122%20and%20army%2C%20according%20to%20GB%20government%20spokesperson%20Faizullah%20Faraq.">stranded</a> on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.</p>
<p>He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.</p>
<p>“The Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,” Faraq said.</p>
<p>He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.“</p>
<p>Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.</p>
<p>He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ​​Babusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.</p>
<p>The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.</p></p>

            <p><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan’s sons met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1881184">Richard Grenell</a> on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father’s release from prison.</p>
<p>Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910789">called attention</a> to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Imran, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1768528">imprisoned</a> since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885831">£190 million</a> corruption case and also faces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1845818">pending</a> trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p>
<p>Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release — posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to “stay strong”.</p>
<p>“There are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.”</p>

<p>Imran’s sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1747390#:~:text=Dr%20Asif%20Mahmood%2C%20a%20Pakistani%20American%20physician%20who%20is%20playing%20a%20key%20role%20in%20the%20campaign%20to%20win%20over%20Americans">key role</a> in the PTI’s campaign to win over Americans.</p>
<p>Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier’s sons.</p>
<p>“Immense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan’s freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>He also praised Grenell for “standing for justice and principle” and called for unity to free the PTI founder.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922952/imran-shuns-dialogue-plans-nationwide-protest#:~:text=Ms%20Khan%20said%20that%20Imran%E2%80%99s%20sons%2C%20Qasim%20and%20Suleiman%2C%20will%20go%20to%20the%20US">said</a> the two brothers will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.</p>
<p>Although the government has not officially commented on the matter, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">told</a> <em>Dawn.com</em> that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Malik also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923089">said</a> that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923275/pml-n-leaders-issue-conflicting-statements-on-allowing-imrans-sons-to-enter-pakistan">conflicting</a> statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p></p>

            <p><p>Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were injured in a “terrorist attack” at a police checkpoint in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Wednesday, a police spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, Spokesperson for the Bannu Police Aamir Khan said, “Terrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel in Bannu.</p>
<p>“As a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.”</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Spokesperson Khan added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.</p>
<p>“Police teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,” he said.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">surge</a> in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.</p>
<p>Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">broke</a> a ceasefire agreement with the government.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur — have seen a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> reported, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.</p>
<p>A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925895/police-constable-martyred-in-bannu-terrorist-attack">martyred</a> when terrorists attacked him in Bannu while he was returning home from duty.</p>
<p>On July 21, over a dozen terrorists <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1925535">attacked</a> a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.</p>
<p>On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925051">attack</a> on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p></p>
