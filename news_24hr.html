            <p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday Washington hoped that India’s response to the recent attack in occupied Kashmir does not lead to a broader regional conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">civilian</a> and military leadership have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">rejected</a> the accusation and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an <a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372190741112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> on <em>Fox News</em>’ ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’ show.</p>
<p>“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance added.</p>
<p>Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it “terror” and “unconscionable,” while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.</p>
<p>India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington’s ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1643653">withdrawal</a> from neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In recent days, Washington <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907094/us-in-touch-with-india-and-pakistan-urges-work-toward-responsible-solution">urged</a> India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.” India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.</p>
<p>The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.</p>
<p>“This government is in constant communication,” State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at her daily news briefing</p>
<p>“We are asking for a responsible resolution from both parties.”</p>
<p>“As the President articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the US stands strong with India against terrorism, and Prime Minister Modi has our full support,” she said.</p>
<p>Bruce said Secretary Rubio encouraged both countries to work toward a responsible solution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia.</p>
<p>“We continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries, as I mentioned, at multiple levels.”</p>
<p>Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1907470">vowed</a> to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.</p>
<p>After the attack, India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspended</a> the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907663#:~:text=PAF%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20response.-,Airspace%20concerns,-With%20tensions%20running">closed airspace</a> to each other’s airlines.

<p>Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.</p>
<p>“The discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,” a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1918037479095189670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.</p>
<p>“The ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability,” it added.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>“So I don’t think there would be any travel until there’s a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they’ve both accepted his good offices,” he added.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday held a telephonic conversation with the Foreign Minister of Panama, Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez, the foreign ministry said in a post on X.</p>
<p>“[Dar] briefed him on the current regional situation, including India’s inflammatory propaganda, its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law.</p>
<p>“[Vasquez] emphasized both sides to exercise restraint,” the foreign ministry said. “Being non-permanent members of UNSC, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment for international peace and security.”</p>

            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) bounced back on Friday after a steep <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907713/stock-market-takes-3545-point-dip-after-minister-claims-indian-attack-imminent">plunge</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 3,150 points, or 2.83 per cent, to stand at 114,476.98 from the last close of 113,954.55 at 12pm.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the market had plunged by more than 3,500 points.</p>
<p>Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “The market is tracking India-Pakistan tensions, and some news flow has indicated de-escalation, prompting a rebound today.”</p>
<p>He continued that investors are now awaiting inflation data due later today and the monetary policy announcement on Monday, with expectations of a rate cut ranging from 50 to 100 basis points.</p>
<p>“Additionally, Pakistan’s IMF [International Monetary Fund] <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317">board approval</a> is scheduled for the 9th. As a result, market participants are primarily focused on developments regarding regional tensions, interest rates, and the upcoming IMF decision.”</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, also attributed the increase to the lack of any military action from India.</p>
<p>“[This] has boosted investor confidence, prompting them to take positions in stocks that align well with Pakistan’s improving economic conditions.”</p>

            <p><p>India’s aviation regulator has allowed Air India to temporarily extend the maximum duty hours and rest period for pilots on long-haul routes to allow the airline to tackle Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906341/indian-airlines-hit-by-ripple-effects-of-pakistan-ban-on-using-airspace">airspace ban</a>, according to an internal memo.</p>
<p>The exemption is for about two weeks beginning April 30 and is applicable for Airbus and Boeing long-haul jets, according to the memo, and is meant to cover flights to destinations in the US.</p>
<p>The exemption has been put in place while a permanent solution is being worked out, a source familiar with the matter told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>The exemption increases the maximum flight duty period — typically the time between reporting for duty and the end of flight-related activities — for pilots and cabin crew, the memo showed.</p>
<p>Air India and India’s civil aviation ministry, which houses the regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Indian airlines are bracing for higher fuel costs and longer journey times after</p>
<p>Pakistan shut its airspace to the country’s carriers as <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907878/pakistan-presses-diplomatic-gains-as-tensions-simmer">tensions</a> between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared following an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">attack</a> on tourists in India-held Kashmir last week.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported on Thursday that Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if the ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year, and has asked the federal government to compensate it for the hit.</p>
<p>The maximum pilot flight duty period for a flight of up to 12 hours is now 16 hours compared with the previous 14 hours, while for flights above 14 hours, the duty period has risen to 24 hours instead of 22 hours, according to the memo sent to pilots and seen by <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Extra rest periods of four hours and 12 hours over present limits have also been planned for crew at layovers and the home base, respectively.</p>
<p>The memo, which was earlier reported by the <em>Economic Times</em> newspaper, has stoked concerns among pilots about increased workloads at a time air travel in India is booming, with one Air India pilot telling <em>Reuters</em> the measures were “extreme”.</p>
<p>The DGCA is holding regular conversations with airlines to ensure pilots and cabin crew are not overburdened, the source familiar with the issue said. The pilot and the source declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p></p>
