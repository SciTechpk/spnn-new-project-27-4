                <h2>PM Shehbaz arrives in Gilgit to review monsoon damages, distribute relief funds</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday on a one-day visit to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>Floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across GB on July 21, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the prime minister, <em>PTV News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1952263870954791012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government‚Äôs full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, PM‚Äôs political aide Rana Sanaullah and PM‚Äôs coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,‚Äù <em>PTV</em> added.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz will be briefed on the damages caused by the recent rainfall and he will also hold meetings with Governor Shah and CM Gulbar.</p>
<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, ‚ÄúThe hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,‚Äù Faraq highlighted.</p>
<p>As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe¬≠aled to the federal government for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838">Rs7bn in emergency funds</a> to deal with climate-induced disasters.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCooperation from the federal government plays the role of Oxygen for GB,‚Äù the official said, stressing that ‚Äúhomeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds‚Äù.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz‚Äôs visit a ‚Äúgood omen‚Äù, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">heat¬≠¬≠waves</a>, erratic weat¬≠her patterns and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">glacial melting</a> have triggered <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a> and intense floods across the region.</p>
<p>Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB‚Äôs Ghizer District were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/5-family-members-stranded-due-to-floods-in-gb-rescued-after-4-days">rescued today</a>, the region‚Äôs Rescue 1122 said.</p>
<p>Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955/cloudburst-causes-floods-in-ghizer-hunza">Ghizer and Hunza</a> districts.</p>
<p>On Friday, a <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">glacier burst</a> in GB‚Äôs Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144#:~:text=Tragedies%20mount%20in%20GB">went missing</a> after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.</p></p>

            <p><p>Five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) have been rescued and taken to a safe place on the other side of the river by boat, Rescue 1122 Ghizer said on Monday.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923845/cloudburst-flooding-damages-homes-blocks-roads-in-gb">cloudbursts</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920150">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919360">June</a>. These extreme weather events have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925930">resulted</a> in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>According to Rescue 1122 Ghizer‚Äôs media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of the river in Gopus Khatam village.</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,‚Äù Shakraiz told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFood was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927955">cloudburst-induced floods</a> in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.</p>
<p>On the same day, a glacier burst in GB‚Äôs Bagrot Valley had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928021">resulted</a> in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government‚Äôs spokesperson.</p></p>
