                <h2>President Zardari appoints chief justices of high courts</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423">appointed</a> the chief justices to the four high courts on Monday.</p>
<p>Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.</p>
<p>The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.</p>
<p>Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.</p>
<p>The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922344/chief-justices-of-four-high-courts-likely-to-take-oath-next-week">said</a> the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.</p>
<p>President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p></p>

                <h2>Army chief dismisses ‚Äòfactually incorrect‚Äô claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them ‚Äúirresponsible and factually incorrect‚Äù.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">US-brokered ceasefire</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> reported that the deputy chief of India‚Äôs army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad ‚Äúlive inputs‚Äù on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the ‚Äúfront face‚Äù while China provided ‚Äúall possible support‚Äù, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan ‚Ä¶ said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action ‚Ä¶ he was getting live inputs from China,‚Äù he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He said that India‚Äôs ‚Äúinability‚Äù to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified ‚Äúits lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInsinuations regarding external support in Pakistan‚Äôs successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNaming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.‚Äù</p>

<p>It further stated that ‚Äúin contrast to India‚Äôs strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment‚Äù, Pakistan had forged ‚Äúlasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region‚Äù.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country‚Äôs ‚Äúprincipled stance‚Äù, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a ‚Äúswift and resolute response‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAny attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‚Äòdeeply hurting and more than reciprocal response‚Äô. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,‚Äù the statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,‚Äù the army chief concluded.</p>
<p>He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p></p>
