                <h2>Escalation can outpace diplomacy with no crisis management in place, warns Pakistan‚Äôs top general</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Pakistan‚Äôs top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.</p>
<p>The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi‚Äôs allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">air strikes</a> in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downed five Indian jets</a> in retaliation. After <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">tit-for-tat strikes</a> on each other‚Äôs airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shangri-La Dialogue 2025</a> organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion, titled ‚Äú<a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms</a>‚Äù, Gen Mirza said: ‚ÄúIt has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.‚Äù</p>
<p>He then stressed that an ‚Äúearly resolution of Kashmir [dispute] in line with the UN Security Council <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolutions</a> and as per the aspirations of the people is essential‚Äù for an enduring peace in South Asia.</p>
<p>The CJCSC cautioned: ‚ÄúGiven the Indian policies and polities‚Äô extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.‚Äù</p>

<p>During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the <a class="link--external" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/111955/?ln=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UNSC resolutions</a> that will address many issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,‚Äù the CJCSC pointed out.</p>
<p>He added that unless countries did not ‚Äúenter conflict resolution‚Äù ‚Äî which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution ‚Äî issues would ‚Äúalways erupt‚Äù.</p>
<p>Other speakers on the panel included Canada‚Äôs Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji‚Äôs army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India‚Äôs Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate <a class="link--external" href="https://www.iiss.org/events/shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2025/special-sessions/special-session-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discussion</a> on defence innovation yesterday.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the Kashmir dispute, the CJCSC also noted: ‚ÄúCrisis prevention is better than crisis fighting. Suppressed disputes, whether territorial or ideological, cannot be indefinitely managed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored ‚Äúhow regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries‚Äô belligerence‚Äù, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911867">(DGMO) hotline</a>.</p>
<p>The top general further said that following the military conflict, the ‚Äúthreshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEmboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,‚Äù CJCSC Mirza asserted.</p>
<p>He went on to state that Pakistan desired a ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The CJCSC stressed the need for Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks instead of chalking out new mechanisms. ‚ÄúStates need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" id="conventional-warfare-threshold-now-dangerously-lower" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòConventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower‚Äô</h2>
<p>During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of conventional warfare had ‚Äúsignificantly degraded‚Äù to ‚Äúdangerous levels‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first and the borders become irrelevant mostly, [‚Ä¶] there could be a chance ‚Äî I‚Äôm not trying to create an alarm but I‚Äôm speaking based on logic ‚Äî there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place,‚Äù he warned.</p>
<p>Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were ‚Äúalways confined to the disputed territory‚Äù. ‚Äú[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.‚Äù</p>
<p>The CJCSC further noted: ‚ÄúInstead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">Punjab</a> and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910848">40 civilians</a> losing their lives with 121 others injured.</p>
<p>The military has confirmed that <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910992">13 security personnel</a>, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.</p>
<p>Noting that by those attacks, India had ‚Äúcrossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border‚Äù, Gen Mirza said it had significantly lowered the threshold.</p>
<p>Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, ‚Äújingoistic‚Äù role of Indian media and its leadership‚Äôs mindset, he said, ‚ÄúHad there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.‚Äù</p>
<p>The top general mentioned the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">United States</a>, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the ‚Äúinterlocutors‚Äù.</p>
<p>Speaking on crisis management in Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza termed it the ‚Äúgeopolitical cockpit of the 21st century‚Äù. ‚ÄúIts trajectories will shape the security architecture not only for this region but for the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Offering eight observations, he stated that the crisis management debate in the Asia-Pacific must also focus on South Asia, adding that structures holding the modern state system were losing vitality.</p>
<p>He also called for institutionalised protocols, inclusion of key stakeholders and peaceful dispute resolution; highlighted the importance of communication; and stressed that emerging technologies compress the decision space.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMisconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. We must disarm not only militarily but rhetorically,‚Äù Gen Mirza observed. ‚ÄúPower and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>On the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza made four observations, one being: ‚ÄúAsia-Pacific today appears to be descending into an extended era of great power contestation and strategic uncertainties.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further pointed out that the Asia-Pacific direly needed an ‚Äúinstitutional security architecture organic to the region itself‚Äù, which was missing as it had ‚Äúlargely been guided by extra-regional powers‚Äù.</p></p>

                <h2>Congress says Modi govt ‚Äòmisled‚Äô nation on aerial combat with Pakistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India‚Äôs Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government had ‚Äúmisled the nation‚Äù, amid a furore about the now-acknowledged <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">aircraft losses</a> to Pakistan during the recent conflict.</p>
<p>The remarks come a day after India‚Äôs top general <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914500">confirmed</a> that his country‚Äôs fighter jets were downed by Pakistan but did not specify a number. That admission followed a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.facebook.com/pakistanstrategicforum/videos/attention-bjp-leader-subramanian-swamy-accepts-that-indian-air-force-lost-5x-fig/1016013560662216/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> by Subrahmanyam Swamy, a member of Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but a staunch critic of the Indian premier, that Pakistan had downed five Indian planes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Modi govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,‚Äù Kharge wrote in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/kharge/status/1928783909946318854" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>

<p>He said that in the wake of the remarks made by India‚Äôs Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan in Singapore during an interview, there were some very important questions which needed to be asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Congress party demands a comprehensive review of defence preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil review committee,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Congress leader and Telangana Minister Uttam Reddy separately demanded transparency from the Indian government to reveal the extent of losses, <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/modi-govt-should-come-clean-on-military-losses-suffered-during-op-sindoor-congress-amid-cds-chauhans-remark-3565775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Deccan Herald</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fact that the fighter aircraft were downed is something that the government needs to stop denying. The CDS himself mentioned that. ‚ÄúEarlier Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it indirectly in his briefing along with the DGMO,‚Äù Reddy, himself a former air force pilot, was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Indian fighter jets were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824">shot down</a> by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force‚Äôs late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur‚Äôs Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.</p>
<p>Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911307">took down</a> six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911123"><em>Dawn.com</em> report</a>, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation.
