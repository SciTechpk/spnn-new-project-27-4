                <h2>Russia first country to recognise Afghan Taliban</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>MOSCOW: Russia on Thursday became the first country to formally recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Moscow‚Äôs special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told the state news agency <em>Ria Novosti</em> that the government had ‚Äúrecognised‚Äù the Taliban.</p>
<p>In a statement issued after it accepted the credentials of a new ambassador from Kabul, the foreign ministry said the move would give impetus to the development of productive bilateral cooperation between our countries in various fields.</p>
<p>No other country has formally recognised the Taliban government that seized <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1640974">power</a> in August 2021 after US-led forces staged a chaotic <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1643653">withdrawal</a> from Afghanistan after 20 years of war.</p>
<p>However, China, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Pakistan have all designated ambassadors to Kabul, in a step towards recognition.</p>
<p>The Russian move represents a major milestone for the Taliban administration as it seeks to ease its international isolation.</p>
<p>It is likely to be closely watched by Washington, which has frozen billions in Afghanistan‚Äôs central bank assets and enforced sanctions on some senior leaders in the Taliban that contributed to Afgha¬≠nis¬≠tan‚Äôs banking sector being largely cut off from the international financial system.</p>
<p>In April of this year, Russia‚Äôs top court had suspended the ban on the Afghan Taliban and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904942">removed</a> its designation as a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>At the time, the move was seen as a step towards Moscow normalising ties with the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Recently, shared security interests ‚Äî including the fight against the so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) have drawn Russia and the Taliban closer.</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, Afghanistan‚Äôs foreign minister said on Thursday that Russia‚Äôs decision to become the first country to recognise their government was a ‚Äúbrave decision‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis brave decision will be an example for others‚Ä¶ Now that the process of recognition has started, Russia was ahead of everyone,‚Äù Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a video of a meeting with Dmitry Zhirnov, the Russian ambassador to Kabul, posted on X.</p>

                <h2>US healthcare groups blast passage of Trump‚Äôs tax bill, warn it will harm millions</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Healthcare groups slammed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921894/trump-wins-major-victory-as-big-beautiful-bill-on-domestic-agenda-sails-through-us-congress">passage</a> of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tax-cut and spending bill on Thursday, warning that its sweeping healthcare provisions would inflict widespread harm on millions of Americans.</p>
<p>The bill, when enacted, will overhaul the government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903408">Medicaid</a> healthcare programme that covers around 71 million low-income Americans, introducing changes including mandatory work requirements that are expected to leave nearly 12 million people <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921533/us-senate-okays-divisive-trump-spending-bill-by-slimmest-of-margins#:~:text=Tax%20breaks,%20immigration">uninsured</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>Republicans have said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth. According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1 trillion. Much of those spending cuts come from Medicaid.</p>
<p>Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, an influential US doctors‚Äô group, warned that the Medicaid cuts would limit access to care by leaving millions without health insurance and make it harder for them to see doctors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt will make it more likely that acute, treatable illnesses will turn into life-threatening or costly chronic conditions. That is disappointing, maddening, and unacceptable,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents local, nonprofit health plans, also rebuked the bill‚Äôs passage, saying it would drive up consumer costs while slashing federal health spending to historic levels.</p>
<p>The group pledged to work with policymakers to minimise disruption for communities.</p>
<p>Greg Kelley, president of the Service Employees International Union‚Äôs healthcare branch, representing Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas, called the bill a ‚Äúmoral failure‚Äù that threatened healthcare access, jobs, and the stability of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare programme at Northwestern University‚Äôs Kellogg School of Management, said their research showed such cuts would hurt patient health. He said expanding Medicaid had saved lives and cutting it back was likely to have the opposite impact.</p>
<p>Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins health policy professor and adviser to the conservative Paragon Health Institute, said she expected the private market would step in as able-bodied adults lose Medicaid and subsidies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese people will come back to the private market,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe financial burden to purchase insurance will be shifted away from US taxpayers to these people‚Äôs shoulders.‚Äù</p></p>
