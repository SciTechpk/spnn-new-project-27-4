            <p><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.</p>
<p>“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.</p>
<p>“The prime minister briefed the president on the government’s measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country’s stability, development, and prosperity,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.</p>

<p>The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency.</p>
<p>The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.</p>
<p>Naqvi said earlier this month that there were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922412/dar-naqvi-allay-fears-over-breach-in-coalition">no plans</a> to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.</p>

<p>He had to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923413/mohsin-naqvi-rubbishes-reports-about-presidential-system">dismiss the reports again</a> last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.</p>
<p>“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion — nor does any such idea exist — about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” Naqvi had posted on X.</p>
<p>He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe­ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924397/gujranwala-court-dismisses-post-arrest-bail-plea-of-ahmadi-man-held-for-distributing-muharram-niaz' target='_blank'><strong>Gujranwala court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Ahmadi man held for ‘distributing Muharram Niaz’</strong></a>
            <p><p>A Gujranwala court on Tuesday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of an Ahmadiyya community member, who was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922568/ahmadi-man-in-gujranwala-arrested-in-blasphemy-case-for-distributing-free-food-on-ashura-police">arrested on blasphemy charges</a> for distributing Niaz (free food and drinks) on the 10th of Muharram (Youm-i-Ashur).</p>
<p>The first information report (FIR) against the suspect was lodged with the Satellite Town police station in Punjab’s Gujranwala city on the complaint of a Hafizabad Road resident under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.</p>
<p>In the FIR, the complainant said the incident took place on July 6 at 4:30pm when he saw the suspect distributing free food and drink during Muharram, “posing as a Muslim”. The Ahmadi man was subsequently arrested and sent on judicial remand.</p>
<p>Gujranwala Judicial Magistrate Sidra Gul Nawaz presided over a hearing for the man’s post-arrest bail plea today.</p>
<p>The court order, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, said that the suspect was “found guilty” during the investigation and “sufficient material has come on record connecting him with the commission of the offence”, adding that a large silver cooking pot with chicken biryani was recovered from him.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that the offence under Section 298(C) was related to matters concerning the religious sentiments of a particular community and carried “serious repercussions for law and order”.</p>
<p>Thus, the order said that as a “necessary corollary” of the above, the post-arrest bail plea was dismissed.</p>
<p>PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had condemned the Ahmadi man’s arrest and expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.</p>
<p>Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915235">asked</a> the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.</p>
<p>In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.</p>
<p>In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895896/mob-led-attacks-on-ahmadis-growing-says-hrcp">mob-led attacks</a> on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.</p>
<p>The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.</p>
<p>The <a class="link--external" href="https://hrcp-web.org/hrcpweb/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2025-Under-siege-EN.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.</p>
<p>HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p></p>

            <p><p>International human rights organisation Amnesty International on Tuesday called upon Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti to “release all detained Baloch activists”.</p>
<p>In March, Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) members were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899608">arrested</a> for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1899479/tear-gas-water-cannon-employed-to-disperse-baloch-yakjehti-committee-protesters-in-quetta">police crackdown</a> while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p>
<p>“I urge you [Balochistan CM] to release all Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” the sample letter by Amnesty read.</p>
<p>It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.</p>
<p>“End the wider crackdown against activists and protesters across the province by allowing them to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression without undue restriction,” the letter urged.</p>
<p>“The crackdown on Baloch activists, including Mahrang Baloch, Bebarg Zehri, Beebow Baloch, Shah Jee Sibghat Ullah, Ghafar Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, violate Pakistan’s international human rights commitments, particularly the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” the letter continued.</p>
<p>Amnesty said that laws such as the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO) and Anti-Terrorism Act have been used to prolong their arbitrary detention in violation of their rights to liberty and due process.</p>
<p>“This is part of a wider crackdown on human rights in Balochistan through suppression of peaceful assembly, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions,” the human rights organisation said.</p>
<p>It expressed concern for the safety and well-being of all those detained, as “access to family members and lawyers is regularly blocked by prison authorities.”</p>
<p>The letter said that the continued detention of the six Baloch activists, beyond the 90-day period allowed under MPO, has already long passed and violates the law.</p>
<p>Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the MPO — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.</p>
<p>Last week, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922808/quetta-atc-sends-mahrang-other-byc-activists-on-10-day-physical-remand">handed</a> Mahrang and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.</p>
<p>In May, Amnesty and four other human rights organisations <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913882">had called</a> on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent.</p></p>
