                <h2>PM Shehbaz reiterates willingness to talk on Kashmir, terrorism if India ‚Äòwants in all sincerity‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1714822">willingness</a> to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same ‚Äúin all sincerity‚Äù.</p>
<p>The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237">tour to friendly countries</a> to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">recent conflict</a> with India.</p>
<p>Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: ‚ÄúI have said in all humility that we want peace in the region [‚Ä¶] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier also touched upon the issue of terrorism: ‚ÄúI have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades,‚Äù he highlighted.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz also expressed willingness to resume trade if India was willing to cooperate on the issues, including counterterrorism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,‚Äù he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.</p>

<p>On India‚Äôs unilateral move to hold the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">Indus Waters Treaty</a> in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">abeyance</a>, the premier said: ‚ÄúIndia tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan ‚Äî 240 million people ‚Äî for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think this is most unfortunate that India <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911383">tried to threaten</a> to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>During his address, Shehbaz noted: ‚ÄúThe world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought.‚Äù</p>
<p>Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which ‚Äúwas obviously very serious‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted Erdogan‚Äôs ‚Äúfirm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan‚Äù, as well as Aliyev‚Äôs unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan‚Äú had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.</p>

<p>The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan‚Äôs response, noting the ‚Äúgreat bravery and the highest level of professional acumen‚Äù of the armed forces under his leadership.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression.‚Äù</p>

<p>Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today‚Äôs summit ‚Äúreflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers‚Äù.</p>
<p>Recalling the ‚Äúmost fruitful discussions‚Äù at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843759">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, ‚ÄúWe are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,‚Äù he asserted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting the ‚Äúoutpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan‚Äù for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: ‚ÄúWe could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan‚Äôs recent conflict with India.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that India ‚Äúnot only <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">failed</a> to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral, transparent investigation</a> into the so-called <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">incident in Pahalgam</a> by any international body‚Äù.</p>
<p>At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. ‚ÄúThe way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.‚Äù</p>
<p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for ‚Äúvery skillfully resolving the issue‚Äù of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels‚Äô recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910519">decision to disband</a>. ‚ÄúThat goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.‚Äù</p>

<p>Addressing the summit, Erdogan expressed Turkiye‚Äôs willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan: ‚ÄúOur hope is that the declared ceasefire will evolve into permanent peace. Turkiye is ready to make every possible contribution to this end.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stressing that developments in the region revealed how important ‚Äúsolidarity among our countries is‚Äù, Erdogan said: ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the ceasefire that ended the tension which erupted between Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI once again congratulate our brother Shehbaz and the Pakistani authorities for the calm and prudent attitude they displayed during the process,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe are three brotherly countries sharing common ideals based on mutual affection, respect and trust nourished by the same climate of civilisation. We are further strengthening the bond among our countries.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting that the three countries collectively had an economic size of $1.5 trillion, the Turkish president said, ‚ÄúWe stand behind each and every step towards transforming our relationship into a strategic partnership.‚Äù</p>
<p>He noted that their countries were located in a highly strategic region and faced a variety of challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the coming period, our foreign ministers will carry out the required work to institutionalise our trilateral cooperation and they will prepare a strong framework that reflects the common vision of our countries,‚Äù he said, mentioning the trade, energy, defence and counterterrorism fields.</p>
<p>The president also noted plans to cooperate in transport, education, energy security, food supply security and renewable energy.</p>
<p>Erdogan also slammed Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúrelentless cruelty and expansionist policies in Palestine‚Äù, terming it the ‚Äúclearest example of crisis of the international system‚Äù. He called for increased global pressure on Israel for a permanent ceasefire and uninterrupted aid into the enclave.</p>

<p>Kicking off the summit, President Aliyev said: ‚ÄúThe recent tensions between Pakistan and India had troubled us the most and we watched it very closely in the hope that peace would prevail, and from the early hours we have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo">expressed our solidarity</a> with brotherly Pakistan.</p>

                <h2>Delegation presenting Pakistan‚Äôs stance on escalation with India to meet on June 2: Sherry</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911617/pm-tasks-bilawal-with-presenting-pakistans-case-for-peace-on-global-arena">high-level delegation</a> tasked with presenting Pakistan‚Äôs position on the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911486/experts-sceptical-about-longevity-of-ceasefire-between-pakistan-and-india">ongoing dispute</a> with India has scheduled to meet on June 2, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911791">decided</a> to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.</p>
<p>The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Speaking on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> programme ‚ÄòDoosra Rukh‚Äô, Senator Rehman said that the diplomatic committee had decided to visit various countries before Eidul Azha.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee, headed by Bilawal, will begin its tour of various countries on June 2, starting from New York,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>She added, ‚ÄúThe committee will first go to New York, then Washington, followed by London, and then Brussels.‚Äù</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Rehman further said that Bilawal had emphasised that there was no hurry as Pakistan ‚Äúis not concerned with the Indian delegation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBilawal has said that we have our own stance and that we have enough content for our defence,‚Äù she said, adding that the PPP chairman wanted a ‚Äúsubstantive [and] quality meeting‚Äù.</p>
<p>Speaking about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order">recent remarks</a> regarding the Indus Water Treaty, saying ‚ÄúNo politician, especially a PM, says things like that.‚Äù</p>
<p>She added that Modi wanted the region to remain in ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù to prevent any space for negotiations.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with the Saudi television network <em>Al-Arabiya</em>, the senator warned that stability in a volatile region is not possible with Modi‚Äôs escalatory rhetoric.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe is pushing the region toward a dangerous new abnormal, which cannot possibly be acceptable to anyone,‚Äù Senator Rehman said. ‚ÄúNothing is normal or rational about this doctrinal shift in India‚Äôs foreign policy.‚Äù</p>
<p>She highlighted that India was also mining more groundwater than any other country in the world, especially from the Indus River Basin, while trying to cut off what they can of Pakistan‚Äôs water lifeline, stating that this is ‚Äútotally unsustainable or acceptable in today‚Äôs climate-stressed world‚Äù.</p>
