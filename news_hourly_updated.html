                <h2>Section 144 announced across Punjab from Muharram 1-10</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Punjab government has imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.</p>
<p><a class="link--external" href="https://punjabpolice.gov.pk/faqs#:~:text=What%20is%20section%20144%20and%20what%20does%20it%20imply?,-Top&amp;text=Section%20144%20of%20the%20Code,a%20specific%20period%20of%20time." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 144</a> is a legal provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.</p>
<p>A Punjab Home Department order issued on Friday, a copy of which is available with <em>Dawn.com</em>, stated that the section was imposed to prevent ‚Äúdisruption of public peace and instability‚Äù, along with ensuring the public‚Äôs ‚Äúsafety and security of lives and property‚Äù.</p>
<p>The notification cited ‚Äúpotential threat to the public peace and tranquillity, religious harmony, and general law and order situation in the province from miscreants, violent extremists, and antisocial elements‚Äù.</p>
<p>For the first 10 days of Muharram, which is likely to begin on <a class="link--external" href="https://hamariweb.com/islam/islamic-calendar.aspx#google_vignette" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">June 27 or 28</a> in Pakistan, the government has prohibited ‚Äúinnovations of Muharram processions [and] <em>majalis</em>‚Äù.</p>
<p>It has also banned carrying any article that may be used as a weapon of offence ‚Äî including bamboo sticks (batons), knives, daggers and spears ‚Äî as well as combustible material at public places without a competent authority‚Äôs permission.</p>
<p>There will also be a complete ban on slogans and gestures ‚Äúthat may incite public sentiments, or directly or indirectly hit the belief of any sect, community or group‚Äù.</p>
<p>Dissemination of information or making ‚Äúabusive or derogatory remarks through any information system or device‚Äù that provoke or are likely to provoke interfaith, sectarian or racial hatred will be prohibited as well.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>Spectators will be barred from the rooftops of buildings on the routes and in front of shops located along the routes during processions, the order added. It further banned the construction of <em>morchas</em> (firing bays) on rooftops of such buildings and the collection of stones, bricks, bottles or garbage along the procession routes.</p>
<p>On Muharram 9 and 10, pillion riding will also be prohibited except for senior citizens, women and law enforcement personnel, the order added.</p>

<p>The Punjab home department has started <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917053">taking measures</a>, including deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p>
<p>It has sought each district‚Äôs need for army and Rangers troops, along with requirements for mobile jamming, with specific location and duration. It has also stated that a ban on loudspeakers should be fully enforced under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1156305">Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act 2015</a> during Muharram.</p>
<p>Deputy commissioners have been asked to discuss and develop contingency plans, update lists of firebrand orators to be gagged or banned, and prevent misuse of loudspeakers during the month.</p>
<p>The DCs have also been informed about the guidelines for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918568/home-dept-issues-sops-for-sabeels-during-muharram">setting up <em>sabeels</em></a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918538/army-rangers-to-help-police-maintain-peace-during-muharram">Rawalpindi</a>, five companies of the Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed to help the administration and police maintain law and order.</p>
<p>The district administration has banned the entry of 169 religious leaders and <em>zakireen</em> in the district and also issued gagging orders for 89 clerics during Muharram. As many as 184 people have been placed in the Fourth Schedule.</p>
<p>Section 144 was also imposed during Muharram in Punjab <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844201">last year</a>, with the Pakistan Army and Rangers being <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844623">deployed</a> across the country after <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843992">requests</a> from all provincial governments.</p>
<p>While the Punjab government had also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1843876">requested</a> the interior ministry to shut down social media apps from Muharram 6 to 11 in a bid to avoid sectarian violence, the ministry had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1844147">deferred</a> the decision. However, Facebook was reportedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1846386">restricted</a> across Pakistan on Muharram 10, Yaum-i-Ashura.</p>
<p>In the past, militants have targeted Muharram processions several times, including a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1767347">bomb blast</a> that killed more than 40 people attending the main Ashura procession on Karachi‚Äôs MA Jinnah Road in December 2009.</p></p>

                <h2>India will never restore Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan: Amit Shah</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>India will never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad, and the water flowing to Pakistan will be diverted for internal use, Home Minister Amit Shah said in an interview with <em>Times of India</em> on Saturday.</p>
<p>Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">unilaterally suspended</a> its participation in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274/what-indias-indus-waters-treaty-suspension-means-for-pakistan">1960 IWT</a>, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe.</a></p>
<p>The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India‚Äôs unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a ‚Äúblatant violation and act of water aggression‚Äù, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, it will never be restored,‚Äù Shah told the daily.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably,‚Äù Shah said, referring to the northwestern Indian state.</p>
<p>The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs cabinet, reveal Delhi‚Äôs intentions as Islamabad‚Äôs hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Last month, <em>Reuters</em> reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Pakistan‚Äôs foreign ministry did not immediately respond to <em>Reuters</em>‚Äô request for comments.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>But it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906354">an act of war</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India‚Äôs decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#held-kashmirs-cm-opposes-diverting-waters-to-other-states" id="held-kashmirs-cm-opposes-diverting-waters-to-other-states" title="Permalink"></a>Held Kashmir‚Äôs CM opposes diverting waters to other states</h2>
<p>Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state‚Äôs waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India‚Äôs  <em>Telegraph</em> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,‚Äù Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy should I take water to Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?‚Äù he was quoted as having said.</p>
<p>Omar referred to Punjab‚Äôs purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. ‚ÄúWe were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years‚Ä¶. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,‚Äù he said.</p></p>
