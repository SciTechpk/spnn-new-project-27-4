            <p><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) opened the trading week on Monday on a positive trajectory, crossing the intraday high of 135,000 due to increased investor sentiment and improved economic outlook.</p>
<p>The stock market resumed trading at 134,299.76 points and gained 1,170 points in early trading to cross the 135,000 points barrier. The benchmark KSE-100 gained 1841.11 points (1.37pc), and is currently trading at 136,119.27 points as of 12:15pm. The total volume of shares traded is 134,882,053 with a value of Rs 11.12 billion.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction as the stock market surged to cross the all-time high level.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, he said the “significant achievement by the PSX is a clear reflection of the business community’s growing confidence in Pakistan’s economy.”</p>
<p>“The recent positive economic indicators are a testament to his government’s policies moving in the right direction,” he emphasised, reiterating that providing a business-friendly environment remains the government’s top priority.“</p>
<p>He said the country had moved from economic stability towards the path of economic growth, adding that the government of Pakistan was working tirelessly for national development and public welfare.</p>
<p>“This positive outlook follows a period of concerted efforts to stabilise the economy and implement structural reforms, which appear to be gaining traction and restoring investor trust,” he said, per the statement.</p>
<p>The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p>
<p>A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.</p>
<p>Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.</p>
<p>The auto sector further supported market gains. As per the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car sales in June rose 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month to 21,773 units. Full-year FY25 sales grew 43pc to 148,000 units, buoyed by pre-buying ahead of a proposed GST increase on smaller vehicles.</p></p>

Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.</p>
<p>Pakistan experiences Monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>In Bajaur, a woman died after the boundary wall of her house collapsed due to heavy rain and gusty winds, according to the PDMA report, while in Khyber district, two children were swept away in a flash flood after heavy rains.</p>
<p>Per the report, Rescue 1122 officials found the body of one of the children, adding that efforts were underway to find the other missing child. Another child — who was injured after being struck by lightning  — was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.</p>
<p>In Kohat, a man died after the roof of his house caved in, while two children. aged seven and 12,  died as a result of a wall collapse in Malakand.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924124/bitcoin-tops-120000-for-the-first-time' target='_blank'><strong>Bitcoin tops $120,000 for the first time</strong></a>
            <p><p>Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 level for the first time on Monday, marking a milestone for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909554">world’s largest cryptocurrency</a> as investors bet on long-sought policy wins for the industry this week.</p>
<p>Bitcoin scaled a record high of $121,207.55 in the Asian session on Monday, before pulling back slightly to last trade 1.6 per cent higher at $121,015.42.</p>
<p>Starting today, the US House of Representatives will debate a series of bills to provide the digital asset industry with the nation’s regulatory framework it has long demanded.</p>
<p>Those demands have resonated with US President Donald Trump, who has called himself the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915340">“crypto president”</a> and urged policymakers to revamp rules in favour of the industry.</p>
<p>“It’s riding a number of tailwinds at the moment,” said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, citing strong institutional demand, expectations of further gains and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886694">support from Trump</a> as reasons for the bullishness.</p>
<p>“It’s been a very, very, strong move over the past six or seven days, and it’s hard to see where it stops now; it looks like it can easily have a look at the $125,000 level,” he said.</p>
<p>The surge in bitcoin, which is up 29pc for the year so far, has sparked a broader rally across other cryptocurrencies over the past few sessions, even in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1709900">Ether</a>, the second-largest token, scaled a more than five-month top of $3,050.90, while XRP and Solana gained about 3pc each.</p>
<p>The sector’s total market value has swelled to about $3.78 trillion, according to data from <a class="link--external" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Washington declared the week of July 14 as “crypto week”, where members of Congress are set to vote on the Genius Act, the Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.</p>
<p>The most significant bill is the Genius Act, which would create federal rules for stablecoins.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices of crypto-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong similarly surged.</p>
<p>Spot bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera all scaled record highs, while the three ether ETFs managed by the asset managers were up roughly 2pc each.</p></p>
