                <h2>FM Dar calls for unconditional ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access amid Gaza food crisis</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday urged the United Nations Security Council and the international community to bring about an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, along with unrestricted humanitarian access amid a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925922/un-says-israeli-forces-kill-over-1000-aid-seekers-21-die-from-starvation">food crisis</a> in the besieged territory.</p>
<p>Gaza‚Äôs population of more than two million people is facing severe shortages of food and other essentials, with residents frequently killed as they try to collect humanitarian aid at a handful of distribution points.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>The UN on Tuesday said Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started operations. An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking famine warnings. GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925553/israeli-forces-kill-115-palestinians-waiting-for-un-aid">firing on people waiting</a> to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.</p>
<p>The crisis was addressed by FM Dar as he chaired the UNSC‚Äôs Quarterly Open Debate on the ‚ÄúSituation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is time to give the Palestinian people what they have been denied for too long: justice, freedom, dignity, and a state of their own. That is the path to durable peace and stability in the Middle East,‚Äù FM Dar said.</p>

<p>He emphasised that the path to lasting peace lay in upholding international law, ending foreign occupation, rejecting the use of force and advancing solutions through dialogue and diplomacy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGaza has become a graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law,‚Äù Dar said, citing systematic attacks on hospitals, schools, refugee camps and aid convoys.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the unfolding hunger crisis, with a third of Gaza‚Äôs population going days without food, was a dire warning of ‚Äúcatastrophic levels of food insecurity‚Äù.</p>
<p>Calling the Palestinian issue a litmus test for the UN‚Äôs credibility, FM Dar warned that failure to act decisively would embolden impunity and erode the international rules-based order.</p>

<p>He urged the UNSC to pursue with unity and urgency, concrete measures, including an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire across Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories with full implementation of Resolution 2735, unfettered humanitarian access and protection for aid workers, urgent restoration of food and medical supply lines, renewed support for the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, an end to forced displacement and illegal settlement expansion, particularly in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, implementation of the Arab and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation-led reconstruction plan for Gaza and revival of a time-bound political process to achieve a two-state solution in accordance with UN resolutions and international law.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan‚Äôs support for a sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital, FM Dar welcomed recent momentum toward Palestine‚Äôs recognition and UN membership.</p>
<p>He highlighted the upcoming International Conference on the Two-State Solution, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, as a key opportunity for renewed diplomatic progress.</p>
<p>Dar also addressed broader regional issues, urging peaceful resolution of conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, and condemning recent Israeli military actions in Iran.</p>
<p>He reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs support for multilateral diplomacy and adherence to international law as the only path to regional peace and stability.</p>

                <h2>World‚Äôs top court paves way for climate reparations</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The world‚Äôs highest court on Wednesday declared that states are obligated under international law to tackle climate change and warned that failing to do so could open the door to reparations.</p>
<p>In a historic ruling, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said climate change was an ‚Äúurgent and existential threat‚Äù and states had a legal duty to prevent harm from their planet-warming pollution.</p>
<p>Countries breaching their climate obligations were committing a ‚Äúwrongful act‚Äù, the court said in its advisory opinion, which is not legally binding but carries significant moral, political and legal weight.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe legal consequences resulting from the commission of an internationally wrongful act may include ‚Ä¶ full reparations to injured states in the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction,‚Äù said ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa on behalf of the 15-judge panel.</p>
<p>This would be on a case-by-case basis where a ‚Äúsufficient direct and certain causal nexus‚Äù had been shown ‚Äúbetween the wrongful act and the injury‚Äù, the court added.</p>
<p>Historically, rich, industrialised countries have been responsible for the majority of emissions. Iwasawa said these countries had to take the lead in addressing the problem.</p>
<p>Campaigners and countries on the climate frontlines hailed a milestone moment in the fight for accountability from big polluters most responsible for <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913992">global warming.</a></p>
<p>Ralph Regenvanu, the climate change minister for Vanuatu, the small Pacific island nation which spearheaded the case at the Hague, was jubilant.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>AFP</em> outside the court, Regenvanu said it was ‚Äúa very strong opinion at the end‚Äù and better than hoped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe can use these arguments when we talk with our partners, some of the high-emitting states. We can say you have a legal obligation to help us,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis helps us in our arguments. It‚Äôs going to give us a lot more leverage ‚Ä¶ in all negotiations.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#catalyst-for-change" id="catalyst-for-change" title="Permalink"></a>Catalyst for change</h2>
<p>This was the biggest case in ICJ history, and seen as the most consequential in a recent string of landmark climate rulings.</p>
<p>The United Nations had tasked the 15 judges at the ICJ, a UN court in the Hague that adjudicates disputes between nations, to answer two fundamental questions.</p>
<p>First: What must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions for the future?</p>
<p>Second: What are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?</p>
<p>In a detailed summary of the opinion, Iwasawa said the climate ‚Äúmust be protected for present and future generations‚Äù.</p>
<p>The adverse effect of a warming planet ‚Äúmay significantly impair the enjoyment of certain human rights, including the right to life‚Äù, he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Legal and climate experts said the opinion, while not legally binding, could have far-reaching consequences for national courts, legislation and public debate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe court‚Äôs clear and detailed articulation of state obligations will be a catalyst for accelerated climate action and unprecedented accountability,‚Äù David Boyd, a former UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the ruling bound all nations by international law to prevent harm from emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The court was ‚Äúpointing the direction for the entire world and making clear that every nation is legally obliged to solve the climate crisis‚Äù, he told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#classroom-to-court" id="classroom-to-court" title="Permalink"></a>Classroom to court</h2>
<p>Courts have become a key battleground for climate action as frustration has grown over sluggish progress toward curbing planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1226151/paris-agreement-turning-point-for-world-climate-says-obama">Paris Agreement</a>, struck through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has rallied a global response to the crisis, but not at the speed necessary to protect the world from dangerous overheating.</p>
<p>The journey to the Hague began six years ago with students from the climate-imperilled Pacific region fed up with the lack of accountability for the damage afflicting their homelands.</p>
<p>The fight pitted major wealthy economies against the smaller, less developed states, which are most at the mercy of a warming planet.</p>
<p>More than 100 nations and groups made submissions in the Hague, many from the Pacific who gave impassioned appeals in colourful traditional dress.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a perfect ending to a campaign that started in a classroom,‚Äù said Vishal Prasad, director of the student-led campaign that kicked off the case.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have now a very, very strong tool to hold power accountable, and we must do that now. The ICJ has given everything possible,‚Äù he told <em>AFP</em> in the Hague.</p>
<p>John Kerry, the former US special envoy for climate change, told <em>AFP</em>, ‚ÄúIt should not take the stamp of international law to motivate countries to do what is already profoundly in their economic interests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt need another reason to act and accelerate action.‚Äù</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The ruling could also make it easier for states to hold other states to account over climate issues like pollution or emissions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe court can affirm that climate inaction, especially by major emitters, is not merely a policy failure but a breach of international law,‚Äù said Fijian Vishal Prasad, one of the law students who lobbied the government of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean to bring the case to the ICJ.</p>
<p>Although it is theoretically possible to ignore an ICJ ruling, lawyers say countries are typically reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis opinion is applying binding international law, which countries have already committed to,‚Äù Chowdhury said.</p></p>
