                <h2>PM Shehbaz chairs high-level meeting in Gilgit to review monsoon damages</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Monday and chaired a high-level meeting to review the flood damages from the recent monsoon rains and distribute relief funds to the affected people.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of climate cha¬≠nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials#:~:text=two%20sisters%20died%20after%20being%20swept%20away">late June</a>. Situation worsened when deadly floods <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">swept</a> across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926838/gb-seeks-rs7bn-aid-thousands-displaced-in-punjab#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20so%20far%2C%2010%20fatalities%20and%20four%20injuries%20have%20been%20reported.%20Seven%20deaths%20were%20reported%20from%20Babusar%2C%20two%20from%20Thore%20Valley%20(Dia%C2%ADmer)%20and%20another%20from%20Astore%20district.">10 people</a>, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.</p>
<p>Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as ‚Äúunfortunate‚Äù. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan‚Äôs contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891272">top 10 countries</a> that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,‚Äù the premier noted.</p>

<p>Recalling the devastating <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1724134">2022 floods</a>, he said, ‚ÄúAfter that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.‚Äù</p>
<p>In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1721343">losses</a> worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities ‚Äî including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination ‚Äî in assisting with the relief work.</p>
<p>He stressed that he had issued ‚Äúclear‚Äù directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in ‚Äúmitigating the changes arising from climate change‚Äù across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.</p>
<p>The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1822414">Daanish Schools</a> he had promised. ‚ÄúWe will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,‚Äù he assured the GB government.</p>
<p>He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will try to ensure this project‚Äôs completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.‚Äù</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.</p>

<p>The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928144">high-level meeting</a> last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government‚Äôs full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).</p>
<p>Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM‚Äôs coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.</p>

<p>During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.</p>

<p>In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, ‚ÄúThe hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,‚Äù Faraq highlighted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,‚Äù the official said, stressing that ‚Äúhomeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds‚Äù.</p>
<p>Terming PM Shehbaz‚Äôs visit a ‚Äúgood omen‚Äù, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.</p>

            <p><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its ‚Äúshameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region‚Äù.</p>
<p>Early on Sunday, Israel‚Äôs far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B‚ÄôAv, <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/far-right-israeli-minister-leads-mass-illegal-settler-incursion-into-al-aqsa-mosque/3649390" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Anadolu Agency</em> reported</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis sacrilege against one of Islam‚Äôs holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,‚Äù Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.</p>

<p>He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúshameless actions‚Äù were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,‚Äù PM Shehbaz added.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‚Äòthe Temple Mount is ours,‚Äô are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‚ÄëAqsa Mosque,‚Äù the statement said.</p>
<p>It said that Israel‚Äôs expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‚ÄëAqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.‚Äù</p>
