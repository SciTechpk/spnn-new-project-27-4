            <p><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912152/china-says-it-backs-pakistan-in-defending-sovereignty">share</a> a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.</p>
<p>The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> by the military’s media affairs wing.</p>
<p>“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).</p>
<p>China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.</p>
<p>COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.</p>
<p>“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.</p>

<p>Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926523/chinese-leadership-lauds-pakistans-role-in-regional-peace-during-meeting-with-coas-munir">paid an official visit</a> to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924658">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, both countries have strengthened their cooperation in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration">maritime</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925364/pak-china-to-form-panels-for-agriculture-projects">agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923261/pakistan-china-agree-on-joint-media-cooperation-against-fake-news">media</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927081/pakistan-eyes-better-disaster-response-with-new-satellite">disaster management</a> and various <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924072/pakistan-china-to-launch-joint-training-programmes">other fields</a>.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928052/senior-lawyer-gunned-down-in-karachis-dha-police' target='_blank'><strong>Senior lawyer gunned down in Karachi’s DHA: police</strong></a>
            <p><p>A senior lawyer was shot dead while his son was hurt in a suspected targeted attack in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority on Friday afternoon, according to police.</p>
<p>South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told <em>Dawn.com</em> that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA.</p>
<p>“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son came out of the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”</p>
<p>The DIG added that during the preliminary investigation, it transpired that a complainant nominated the slain advocate in a murder case, while in a later incident, Islam sustained injuries in Clifton.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the cases, DIG Raza recalled that in 2021, the complainant filed a first information report (FIR) with Boat Basin police against six to seven unidentified suspects for allegedly killing his father.</p>
<p>“The complainant also attempted to nominate Khawaja Shamsul Islam, but he failed to provide evidence. Thus, the case was disposed of as ‘A’ Class (untraced) by Investigation DSP Clifton division Jahanzaib Khan,” the DIG told <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1872404">second incident</a>, which occurred in 2024, the DIG said that the complainant, another advocate, filed an FIR alleging that while heading for Isha prayers with Khawaja Shamsul Islam in Zamzama neighbourhood of Karachi, they were “ambushed by the complainant in the first case along with 15-20 armed accomplices”.</p>
<p>“The attackers used firearms, iron rods and sticks, injuring Khawaja Shamsul Islam,” he alleged, adding that the attackers had gathered outside the mosque.</p>
<p>DIG Raza pointed out that a preliminary investigation of last year’s attack was conducted by Inspector Maqbool Meher and some suspects were also arrested by the police. However, the case was later transferred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU)/Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Karachi as an “extortion matter”.</p>
<p>In April this year, a judge and a lawyer were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904465">shot dead</a> in an armed attack on the motorway in Nowshera district.</p>
<p>Nowshera Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsud told <em>Dawn.com</em> that one of the slain, Mohammad Hayat, was working as a civil judge in Mardan and belonged to the Swat district.</p>
<p>“The other person was identified as Khalid Khan, a lawyer, belonging to Rustam area of Mardan, who was accompanying the judge.”</p>
<p>Mehsud said that they died on the spot and the bodies were moved to Qazi Hussain Ahmed Medical Complex.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928046/sindh-high-court-suspends-order-removing-ke-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh High Court suspends order removing KE CEO</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday suspended an order by the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women removing K-Electric (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi from his position over allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>A day prior, the ombudsman <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927799">ordered</a> the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.</p>
<p>According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today — available with <em>Dawn.com</em> — his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of “harassment of a sexual or physical nature” before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.</p>
<p>“There was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,” the petition read.</p>
<p>“In the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.”</p>
<p>The plea also noted: “The learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.”</p>
<p>In a court order issued today and seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the SHC said that as per the petitioner, KE was a “trans-provincial entity/establishment” and the provincial ombudsman had no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints, which should instead be addressed by the federal ombudsman.</p>
<p>The order said the “contention raised requires consideration” and said that notices be issued to the respondents, as well as the Sindh advocate general and deputy advocate general for August 8.</p>
<p>“Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,” the order read. It, however, ordered Alvi to deposit the Rs2.5 million penalty with the court’s nazir.</p>
<p>In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.</p>
<p>The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.</p>
<p>Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p></p>
