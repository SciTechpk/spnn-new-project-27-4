                <h2>Security forces kill 14 more ‚ÄòIndian-sponsored‚Äô terrorists along Pak-Afghan border in Zhob: ISPR</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces have killed 14 more terrorists attempting to infiltrate across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob district, the military‚Äôs media wing said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The development adds to 33 terrorists, belonging to the ‚ÄúIndian proxy <em>Fitna al Khwaraj</em>‚Äù, who were eliminated on the night of August 7 and 8.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn [the] night 8/9 August 2025, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Sambaza along Pakistan-Afghanistan border,‚Äù the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7384" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian-sponsored <em>khwarij</em> were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed <em>khwarij</em>,‚Äù the ISPR noted.</p>

<p>This followed the ‚Äúsuccessful engagements by the security forces in general area Sambaza, Zhob District on 7-8 August 2025, during which 33 <em>khwarij</em> were sent to hell‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe number of <em>khwarij</em> killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,‚Äù the military highlighted.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349/govt-proscribes-gul-bahadur-group-majeed-brigade#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna al Khawarij</a></em> is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe security forces remain committed to secure the nation‚Äôs frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan,‚Äù the statement asserted.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces and praised their professionalism.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,‚Äù he said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MOIofficialGoP/status/1954104835948646886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X.</p>
<p>He added, ‚ÄúSecurity forces, through timely operations, sent 47 terrorists of <em>Fitna al-Hindu¬≠stan</em> to hell in two days. By taking swift action, they foiled a sinister conspiracy to sabotage peace in Balochistan.‚Äù</p>

<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>

                <h2>Armenia-Azerbaijan truce: Pakistan again hails Trump‚Äôs efforts for peace</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929655/azerbaijan-and-armenia-sign-peace-deal-at-white-house">peace deal</a>.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with Trump, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897786">conflict</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,‚Äù the premier wrote in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/1954026703321461024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> on X.</p>
<p>He congratulated both countries on ‚Äúcharting a course for a peaceful future for their region‚Äù, stating: ‚ÄúPakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.‚Äù</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz continued: ‚ÄúWe also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the development marks the ‚Äúdawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus‚Äù, which has endured ‚Äúconflict and human suffering‚Äù for decades.</p>

<p>Separately, Trump said that both countries were ‚Äúcommitting to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity‚Äù, while speaking to <a class="link--external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Po1W0CPNhI&amp;pp=ygUkQXplcmJhaWphbiBhbmQgQXJtZW5pYSB0cnVtcCByZXV0ZXJz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporters</a> alongside Azerbaijan‚Äôs Aliyev and Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan.</p>
<p>Trump said the US signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology, including artificial intelligence. Details were not released.</p>
<p>Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p>Trump has tried to present himself as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928543">global peacemaker</a> in the first months of his second term. The White House credits him with brokering a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/trump-says-thailand-and-cambodia-agree-to-hold-immediate-ceasefire-talks">ceasefire</a> between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923026/trumps-claim-on-averting-india-pakistan-war-gains-new-life">India and Pakistan</a>, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920693">Rwanda</a> and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, Trump stated: ‚ÄúAs president, my highest aspiration is to bring peace and stability to the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúToday‚Äôs signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big. And, they were great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict, a nuclear conflict probably.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910625">claimed</a> ‚Äî in contrast to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923175">India‚Äôs stance</a> ‚Äî that US intervention prevented a ‚Äúbad nuclear war‚Äù between India and Pakistan following their most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two countries escalated after the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing">blamed</a> Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">denied</a> the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993">ceasefire</a> on May 10.</p></p>
