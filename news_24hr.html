            <p><p>Two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange or fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s  Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Domel tehsil of Bannu, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan read.</p>
<p>“Resultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed, and Inaam alias Tooru, resident of Haider Khel, North Waziristan.</p>
<p>“The slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED blasts,” the police officer added.</p>
<p>The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones on the suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Hussain Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>RPO Sajid said the Bannu police and CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation has been intensified to arrest the escaped suspects.</p>
<p>He vowed that CTD and police are determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, several suspects were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310">arrested</a> and a cache of heavy weapons seized during a joint search and strike operation carried out by the police, counter terrorism department, and the army in Bannu.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921394/iran-linked-hackers-threaten-to-release-trump-aides-emails' target='_blank'><strong>Iran-linked hackers threaten to release Trump aides’ emails</strong></a>
            <p><p>Iran-linked hackers have threatened to disclose more emails stolen from US President Donald Trump’s circle, after distributing a prior batch to the media ahead of the 2024 US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1870600">election</a>.</p>
<p>In online chats with <em>Reuters</em> on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.</p>
<p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as “an unconscionable cyber-attack”.</p>
<p>The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: “Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.</p>
<p>Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.</p>
<p>The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr — now Trump’s health secretary.</p>
<p>Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.</p>
<p>Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.</p>
<p>After Trump’s election, Robert told <em>Reuters</em> that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told <em>Reuters</em>, “I am retired, man.” But the group resumed communication after this month’s 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites.</p>
<p>In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted <em>Reuters</em> to “broadcast this matter”.</p>
<p>American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.</p>
<p>“A default explanation is that everyone’s been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that’s not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,” he said. “Leaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.”</p>
<p>Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran’s hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran’s crosshairs.</p></p>

            <p><p>At least 39 people died in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921295/chemical-factory-blast-kills-12-in-telangana">factory fire</a> in India’s southern state of Telangana, a senior fire department official said on Tuesday, after an explosion at Sigachi Industries, a day earlier.</p>
<p>The explosion also injured 34, according to officials.</p>
<p>The government of Telangana, where the facility is located, has formed a five-member committee to probe the incident, the cause of which is yet to be disclosed by the company.</p>
<p>“We are still clearing the debris […] The building has collapsed and fabricated completely,” GV Narayana Rao, director of Telangana fire disaster response emergency, told <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>“Once we are all done with the clearing, only then we will be able to assess if any other body is still remaining under the debris or if it is all clear,” he said.</p>
<p>On Monday, an explosion occurred at a chemical facility of Sigachi Industries leading to a fire, the police said.</p>
<p>Police officials said more than 140 people were working in the plant when the incident occurred. Twenty-five of the deceased were yet to be identified, district administrative official P Pravinya said.</p>
<p>Sigachi, which makes microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), caters to clients in the pharma, food, cosmetic and specialty chemicals sectors in countries ranging from the US to Australia.</p>
<p>MCC is primarily used to prevent the formation of lumps in food products, to maintain texture of cosmetic products, and as a fat substitute in low-calorie foods.</p>
<p>The plant contributes a little over a fourth of the company’s total capacity of 21,700 million metric tonnes per annum. Its shares dropped about 6 per cent on Tuesday and were headed for their sharpest two-day drop since listing in 2021.</p>
<p>The company did not say what led to the fire, but said it was halting operations at the facility for 90 days, citing damage to equipment and structures within the plant from the fire.</p>
<p>In a separate incident on Tuesday, five people were killed and four others injured in a massive fire at a crackers factory in the Sivakasi manufacturing cluster in the southern Tamil Nadu state, a fire department official said. The incident is the latest in a series of fire accidents in the area.</p></p>
