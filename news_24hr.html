            <p><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a rebound by as many as 900 points on Tuesday as investors gained confidence from yesterday’s “unexpected” reduction in the interest rate.</p>
<p>The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 990.87 points, or 0.87 per cent, to stand at 115,093.10 from the last close of 114,102.23 at 10:03am.</p>
<p>The State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908700/state-bank-defies-expectations-with-100bps-rate-cut">slash the interest rate</a> by 100 basis points to 11 per cent defied analysts’ expectations that ongoing tensions with India might keep the central bank cautious and lead to no change in the interest rate.</p>
<p>Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the rate cut “provided much-needed impetus to the stock market where investor confidence is deterred by India-Pakistan tensions”.</p>

<p>In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907535/shares-at-psx-slump-on-heightened-pakistan-india-tensions">reduce their holdings</a> as Pakistan has expressed a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907390/credible-intelligence-shows-india-intends-military-action-against-pakistan-in-next-24-36-hours-tarar">heightened possibility</a> of a military action <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907470/modi-gives-his-forces-carte-blanche-for-incursion">by India</a> in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">April 22 attack</a> in Pahalgam killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075/pahalgam-attack-india-suspends-indus-waters-treaty-with-immediate-effect-closes-attari-border-crossing#:~:text=at%20least%2026%20people%20were%20killed%2C%20all%20men%2C%20while%20police%20said%20another%2017%20people%20were%20injured">26 people</a>, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075#:~:text=cross%2Dborder%20linkages%20of%20the%20terrorist%20attack%20were%20brought%20out">cross-border linkages</a>” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907361/not-a-shred-of-evidence-provided-by-india-for-baseless-allegations-against-pakistan-dg-ispr">firmly rejected</a> the claim and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>.</p>
<p>However, Ashraf noted that the “likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor”.</p>
<p>“We believe, escalation at a wider scale would have severe consequences for both nations, particularly given their dependence on external financing and exposure to short-term external liabilities,” he added.</p>
<p>Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also attributed the gains in shares today to the monetary policy, noting that the SBP rate cut was “higher than market expectations”.</p>
<p>Topline Securities Ltd had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908741/stocks-trim-early-losses-on-late-buying-decision">observed</a> yesterday that the benchmark index was volatile, falling by 1,036 points in early trading. However, it made a strong recovery in the second half, mainly supported by the cement sector, as investors expected a possible rate cut in the monetary policy later in the day.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, international rating agency <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608">Moody’s warned</a> that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.</p>
<p>It also said that escalating tensions could <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908739">cause a setback</a> to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908705/chenab-parched-after-india-reduces-flows-manifold' target='_blank'><strong>Chenab parched after India reduces flows manifold</strong></a>
            <p><p><strong>• Pakistan’s waters being used to fill up three Indian reservoirs with total capacity of 1.2MAF; official says sudden discharge could create a ‘flood-like’ situation<br />
• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns<br />
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects</strong></p>
<p>NEARLY a week after its unilateral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906274">suspension</a> of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.</p>
<p>Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.</p>
<p>“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.</p>
<p>According to a document seen by <em>Dawn</em>, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.</p>
<p>The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.</p>
<p>The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.</p>
<p>“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.</p>
<p>To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.</p>
<p>To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.</p>
<p>According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.</p>
<p>According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.</p>
<p>The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Shortage for Kharif crops</strong></p>
<p>Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.</p>
<p>“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.</p>
<p>An official told <em>Dawn</em> that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.</p>
<p><strong>Sindh’s concerns</strong></p>
<p>Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.</p>
<p>Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.</p>
<p>The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.</p>
<p><strong>Work on Indian dams</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.</p>
<p>A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.</p>
<p>The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.</p>
<p>The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.</p>
<p>“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.</p>
<p>The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908798/trump-administration-freezes-future-grants-to-harvard' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration freezes future grants to Harvard</strong></a>
            <p><p>The US Department of Education informed Harvard University on Monday that it was freezing billions of dollars in future research grants and other aid until the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college concedes to a number of demands from the Trump administration, a senior department official said.</p>
<p>The move represents the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906337/trump-slams-harvard-as-funding-fight-heads-to-court">latest salvo</a> from a Trump administration willing to use the power of the federal purse to force institutions, from law firms to universities, to make sweeping policy changes or else lose billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts.</p>
<p>In a letter to Harvard, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about anti-Semitism on campus, school policies that consider a student’s race, and complaints from the administration the university has abandoned its pursuit of academic excellence while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.</p>
<p>“This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided,” McMahon wrote.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Harvard said the McMahon letter doubles down on demands that would impose “unprecedented and improper control” over the university and makes new threats to “illegally” withhold funding for lifesaving research.</p>
<p>“Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,” a university spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The freeze of future funding represents a slightly altered tactic by the Trump administration, whose attempts to freeze top schools of existing funds raised legal eyebrows.</p>
<p>Trump has targeted Harvard over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus during pro-Palestinian protests. The protests were sparked by US ally Israel’s military assault on Gaza after the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas.</p>
<p>Trump has alleged pro-Palestinian protesters are anti-Semitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly conflate their criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza with anti-Semitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the administration began a formal review into nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, demanded the university ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and crack down on some pro-Palestinian groups and masks in protests.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Harvard rejected numerous Trump demands last month, calling them an attack on free speech and academic freedom. It sued the Trump administration after it <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904389">suspended about $2.3 billion in federal funding</a> for the educational institution, while also pledging to tackle discrimination on campus.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Harvard said the government’s funding cuts will have stark “real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, (and) researchers” while putting in jeopardy crucial medical and scientific research.</p>
<p>Harvard has a $53bn endowment, the largest of any US university, but the funds are often restricted and used for things like financial aid and scholarships.</p></p>
