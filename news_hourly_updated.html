<hr />
<p>The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">first struck</a> Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a> the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders</a>, scientists and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918702">hundreds</a> others. Both countries have <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918048/iran-israel-trade-fresh-air-attacks-as-trump-weighs-us-involvement">traded</a> wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.</p>
<p>In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.</p>

<p>The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another ‚Äúforever war‚Äù in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,‚Äù said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordow along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran‚Äôs key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,‚Äù said Trump.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that ‚Äúthe awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history‚Äù.</p>

<p>Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a ‚Äúheads up‚Äù before the strikes, a senior White House official told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.</p>
<p>Tehran said there were ‚Äúno signs of contamination‚Äù after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said ‚Äúno radioactive effects were detected‚Äù in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Iranian media <a class="link--external" href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233460/Official-in-Iran-s-Qom-confirms-attack-on-Fordow-site" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918984/what-are-the-key-sites-in-irans-nuclear-programme">nuclear sites</a>, were attacked.</p>
<p>The US strikes push the Middle East to the brink of a major new conflagration in a region already aflame for more than 20 months with devastating conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as a toppled ruler in Syria.</p>
<p>Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.</p>

<p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth hailed the strikes an ‚Äúincredible and overwhelming success‚Äù, adding that the operation was intended at a regime change in Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe devastated the Iranian nuclear programme, but it is worth noting that the operation did not target the Iranian troops or people,‚Äù Hegseth told a press conference at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The secretary reiterated Trump‚Äôs claims that Iran must never get a nuclear weapon, stating that by employing the president‚Äôs policy of ‚Äúpeace through strength‚Äù, Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions were ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">

    </figure></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hegseth said the strikes were not a preamble to plans for regime change in Iran, adding that private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis mission was not and has not been about regime change,‚Äù Hegseth stated. ‚ÄúThe president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear programme.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world that American deterrence is back,‚Äù Hegseth added. ‚ÄúWhen this president speaks, the world should listen.‚Äù</p>

<p>Hegseth also read a statement from Trump, warning that any retaliation by Iran ‚Äúwill be met with force far greater than what was witnessed tonight‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran would be smart to heed these words,‚Äù the defence secretary warned, adding that US forces were postured to defend themselves, and take action if needed.</p>
<p>Hegseth said that the operation took months of preparation and required ‚Äúa great deal of precision [‚Ä¶] misdirection and highest of operational security‚Äù.</p>
<p>Describing the complex operation, dubbed ‚ÄúMidnight Hammer‚Äù, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said the ‚Äúmain strike package comprised‚Äù of seven <a class="link--external" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/b-2-bombers-moving-guam-amid-middle-east-tensions-us-officials-say-2025-06-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B-2 stealth bombers</a> flying 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran with multiple aerial refuellings.</p>
<p>The US strikes included 14 bunker-buster bombs, more than two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft, the top general added.</p>

<p>Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites sustained ‚Äúextremely severe damage and destruction‚Äù, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIran‚Äôs fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran‚Äôs surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,‚Äù Caine added.</p>

<p>It said the US actions ‚Äî ‚Äúcarried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime‚Äî once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran‚Äù.</p>

<p>Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918331#:~:text=a%20White%20House%20spokesperson%20said%20the%20president%20would%20make%20a%20decision%20on%20whether%20to%20attack%20Iran%20%E2%80%9Cwithin%20two%20weeks%E2%80%9D">within two weeks</a>‚Äù whether to join Israel‚Äôs campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.</p>
<p>But the Republican‚Äôs decision to strike Iran came far sooner.</p>
<p>Flanked by JD Vance, Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be ‚Äúfar greater‚Äù unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRemember, there are many targets left,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Trump, however, made no mention of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917243">regime change</a>, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917651">easy target</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, <em>CBS News</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-launches-strikes-iranian-nuclear-facilities-trump-says/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20reached%20out%20to%20Iran%20diplomatically%20Saturday%20to%20say%20the%20strikes%20are%20all%20the%20U.S.%20plans%20and%20that%20regime%20change%20efforts%20are%20not%20planned%2C%20the%20sources%20said" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724035571020048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> earlier on his Truth Social site that a ‚Äúfull payload of bombs‚Äù was dropped on Fordow, adding that ‚Äúall planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>In another post, the US president called it a ‚Äúhistoric moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world‚Äù. ‚ÄúIran must now agree to end this war,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114724124909451419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914610">in breach</a> of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was ‚Äúyears away from producing one‚Äù, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917691/us-assessment-finds-iran-years-away-from-nuclear-weapon-refutes-israeli-claims">report</a> from <em>CNN</em> released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a ‚Äúmore devastating‚Äù retaliation should Israel‚Äôs nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran‚Äôs right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme ‚Äúcannot be taken away ‚Ä¶ by threats or war‚Äù.</p>
<p>Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.</p>

<p>After the address, Trump warned Iran against ‚Äúany retaliation‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that ‚Äúsuicide drones‚Äù had been launched against ‚Äústrategic targets‚Äù across Israel.</p>
<p>Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran‚Äôs Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.</p>

<p>The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.</p>

<p>However, the issue has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918298/prospect-of-iran-strike-exposes-divisions-in-trumps-maga-base">opened a split</a> in Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs first <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1295226">2016 election victory</a> in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Republican <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1936564082477531596" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> said, ‚ÄúThere would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: ‚ÄúThis is not our fight.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEvery time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,‚Äù Greene said.</p>

                <h2>Operation Midnight Hammer: Pentagon details ‚Äòlargest B-2 operational strike in US history‚Äô</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine on Sunday delivered a press briefing, providing details of the air strikes and bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said US air strikes on Sunday ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842/trump-says-irans-key-nuclear-facilities-obliterated-by-us-airstrikes">totally obliterated</a>‚Äù Iran‚Äôs main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel‚Äôs war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The US operation, called Midnight Hammer, was described by Gen Caine as the ‚Äúlargest B-2 operational strike in US history‚Äù, which inflicted ‚Äúextremely severe damage and destruction‚Äù to the targets, US outlet <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-briefing-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBS News</a></em> reported.</p>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of this plan,‚Äù Gen Caine said, adding that seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew east from their base in Missouri to participate in the mission in Iran.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt midnight, Friday into Saturday, a large B-2 strike package, comprised of bombers, launched from the continental United States. As part of a plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy,‚Äù he stated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThroughout its 18-hour flight, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight refuellings. Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft once over land in the Middle East in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace.‚Äù Caine explained, adding that this was done with minimal communication.</p>

<p>Speaking while displaying a map tracing the flight path and timelines of the US bombers, the chairman said: ‚ÄúAt about 5pm Eastern Time (ET) [on] Saturday, just before the aircraft entered Iranian airspace, a US submarine in the Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the US deployed several deception tactics, including decoys, as fourth and fifth-generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats.‚Äù</p>

<p>Gen Caine outlined that US Strategic Command, Transportation Command, Cyber Command, Space Command and the Space Force and US European Command all provided support during the strikes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Outlining the bombing raid, Gen Caine said that at about 6:40pm ET (2:10am in Iran) the lead B-2 ‚Äúdropped two GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) weapons on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the president stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6:40pm and 7:05pm ET ‚Ä¶ with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Isfahan to ensure that we retained the element of surprise throughout the operation.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing weapons release, the Midnight Hammer strike package exited Iranian airspace and began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package on the way out,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs fighters did not fly, and it appears Iran‚Äôs surface-to-air missile systems did not see us.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Gen Caine, the US employed 75 ‚Äúprecision-guided weapons‚Äù during Operation Midnight Hammer, including the MOPs, marking their first operational use by the US military.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMore than 125 US aircraft participated in this mission, including B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth-generation fighters, dozens and dozens of air refuelling tankers ‚Ä¶ and a full array of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational professionals,‚Äù Gen Caine said.</p>
<p>The chairman warned that the US is prepared for any retaliatory attack by Iran, stating that any such attack would be an ‚Äúincredibly poor choice‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will defend ourselves; the safety of our service members and civilians is the highest priority. Many assets are still airborne, and we have hundreds deployed.‚Äù</p></p>
