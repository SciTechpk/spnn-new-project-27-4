                <h2>Mastung blast derails 6 bogies as Jaffar Express targeted 2nd time in a week</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>No loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express, an official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province‚Äôs transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways‚Äô Quetta division, told <em>Dawn.com</em>: ‚ÄúA bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung‚Äôs Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSecurity forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,‚Äù Kashif said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúFour bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,‚Äù the official noted.</p>
<p>A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.</p>
<p>The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ‚Äúin its proper turn‚Äù and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929447">narrowly escaped</a> a disaster in Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>

<p>In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1926300">damaging a bogie</a> of the Bolan Mail.</p>
<p>A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh‚Äôs Sukkur was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927185">initially attributed</a> to an explosion ‚Äî even by government-run media ‚Äî but the Ministry of Railways later said a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927307">technical fault</a> was the cause.</p>
<p>In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917945">derail in Jacobabad</a>. No one was hurt in the incident.</p>
<p>In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904018">stopped</a> at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Train services betw¬≠een Quetta and the rest of the country were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900566">restored</a> on March 27, after they were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897306/all-trains-to-and-from-balochistan-suspended">suspended</a> due to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419">unprecedented hijacking</a> of the Pesha¬≠war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.</p>
<p>The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897595/balochistan-standoff-ends-after-all-jaffar-express-hostages-rescued#:~:text=In%20all%2C%2021%20passengers%20lost%20their%20lives%2C%20while%20four%20FC%20personnel%20were%20martyred%2C%20the%20ISPR%20DG%20said.">21 passengers</a> and four security personnel. ‚ÄúAll 33 terrorists‚Äù were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p></p>

                <h2>Azerbaijani president phones PM Shehbaz, appreciates Pakistan‚Äôs support on Karabakh issue</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday evening received a telephone call from Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who expressed his appreciation for Pakistan‚Äôs consistent support on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, a statement from the PM‚Äôs office said.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929655/azerbaijan-and-armenia-sign-peace-deal-at-white-house">signed</a> an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897786">conflict</a>, the White House said.</p>
<p>The PM on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump‚Äôs peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal, congratulating both countries on ‚Äúcharting a course for a peaceful future for their region‚Äù and stating: ‚ÄúPakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said that he had a phone call with Aliyev, where he conveyed warm felicitations to him and the people of Azerbaijan on the peace deal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLauded him for his vision and statesmanship, and deeply appreciated President Donald Trump, who played the role of peace maker in facilitating this landmark agreement,‚Äù the prime minister wrote.</p>

<p>During today‚Äôs phone call, PM Shehbaz offered his warm felicitations to Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on the historic peace agreement and hailed Trump‚Äôs role in the peace process.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring their warm and cordial telephone conversation, the prime minister lauded the visionary role of President Ilham Aliyev in bringing the three-decades-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia to a peaceful and mutually beneficial end, especially as it would usher in a new era of prosperity for the Caucasus,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister particularly appreciated the role played by US President Donald Trump in facilitating this historic deal that would now bring peace and prosperity to the region.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Aliyev expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan‚Äôs longstanding and consistent support for Azerbaijan on the Karabakh issue,‚Äù the statement added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe prime minister responded that it has always been a matter of duty for the people of Pakistan to extend their support to their Azerbaijani brothers and sisters on this core issue and it was heartening to note that, under President Aliyev‚Äôs bold leadership and statesmanship, peace had finally been established in this region.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aliyev told PM Shehbaz that peaceful development in the region would create new opportunities for enhanced connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia. The statement said that both leaders also expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1928393">bilateral cooperation</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile recalling their recent interactions in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657">Lachin</a> and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922079">Khankendi</a>, the prime minister reiterated his invitation to President Aliyev to undertake an official visit to Pakistan soon,‚Äù the statement added. ‚ÄúBoth leaders are also expected to meet in Tianjin on the margins of the upcoming SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929105/modi-to-visit-china-for-first-time-in-7-years-as-tensions-with-us-rise#:~:text=China%20for%20a%20summit%20of%20the%20multilateral%20Shanghai%20Cooperation%20Organisation%20(SCO)%20that%20begins%20on%20Augst%2031">summit</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan had been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh ‚Äî a mountainous Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population ‚Äî broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.</p>
<p>Baku and Yerevan fought two wars for control of Azerbaijan‚Äôs Armenian-populated region of Nagorno Karabakh, at the end of the Soviet Union and again in 2020, before Azerbaijan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1778457">seized</a> the entire area in a 24-hour offensive in September 2023.</p></p>
