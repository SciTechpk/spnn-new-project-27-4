            </a>
            <p><p>Indonesia‚Äôs Defence Minister Lt Gen (retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin expressed his country‚Äôs desire to boost defence ties and explore possible collaboration in defence production as he met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1700731/works-show-cross-cultural-influences-between-pakistan-indonesia">culture</a>, with both countries cooperating in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854006">trade</a>, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1771602/pakistani-students-received-highest-number-of-indonesian-scholarships-envoy">education</a>, and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920509">health</a>.</p>
<p>Gen Sjamsoeddin called on PM Shehbaz at the PM Office today, where he reiterated Indonesia‚Äôs desire to ‚Äúfurther strengthen defence ties with Pakistan and to explore possible areas for cooperation, especially in defence production‚Äù, according to a <a class="link--external" href="https://pid.gov.pk/site/press_detail/29707" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> from government-run PID.</p>

<p>The Indonesian minister conveyed the best wishes of President Prabowo Subianto for the prime minister and people of Pakistan, the press release added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz ‚Äúreaffirmed Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to explore and expand collaboration with Indonesia in joint ventures of investment in mutually beneficial projects‚Äù, the statement said.</p>
<p>The prime minister also reiterated Pakistan‚Äôs commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation with Indonesia in all avenues, including economic, strategic and trade sectors, along with defence and defence production.</p>
<p>He highlighted that Pakistan and Indonesia enjoyed a ‚Äúlongstanding friendship rooted in shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, supporting each other at international forums‚Äù.</p>
<p>Both sides stressed the importance of ‚Äúenhancing multifaceted bilateral cooperation‚Äù, according to the PID.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe meeting underscored the deep-rooted historical, brotherly and friendly bilateral relations between Pakistan and Indonesia,‚Äù the statement noted.</p>
<p>Recalling his meeting last year with Indonesia‚Äôs President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1879720">Developing-8 Summit in Cairo</a>, PM Shehbaz conveyed his best wishes for the Indonesian president.</p>
<p>The prime minister also reviewed ongoing initiatives under the Pakistan-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and agreed to ‚Äúaccelerate the implementation of key areas of mutual interest‚Äù, the PID added.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920509">June</a>, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.</p>

                <h2>UK introduces e-visa for Pakistani students, workers</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom‚Äôs government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-evisas-for-pakistani-students-and-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: ‚ÄúThe UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.‚Äù</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/JaneMarriottUK/status/1945002473325752743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that the facility was for ‚Äúmost students and workers applying for more than 6 months‚Äù.</p>

<p>An e-visa is an online record of a person‚Äôs immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúE-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,‚Äù it highlighted.</p>
<p>Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.</p>
<p>In 2024, the UK government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854346">announced</a> that the country‚Äôs immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p>
<p>The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, including short-term study for 11 months</li>
<li>Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Global Talent‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>International Sportsperson‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Skilled Worker (including health and care)‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes)‚ÄØ</li>
<li>Youth Mobility Scheme‚ÄØ‚ÄØ</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.</p>
<p>Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.</p>
<p>Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. ‚ÄúIt also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,‚Äù she pointed out.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person‚Äôs present immigration status.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHolders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The UKVI ‚Äî introduced in 2024 ‚Äî is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people‚Äôs immigration status.</p></p>
