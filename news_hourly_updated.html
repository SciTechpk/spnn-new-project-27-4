                <h2>NAB gets bids for three Bahria Town properties</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau on Thursday sold off one already-sealed Bahria Town property, and received conditional bids for two others ‚Äî at a combined value of Rs2.27 billion ‚Äî in a long-awaited <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929028">auction.</a></p>
<p>The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a ‚Äúlack of qualifying bids‚Äù.</p>
<p>Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB‚Äôs regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.</p>
<p>Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.</p>
<p>Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.</p>
<p>According to NAB‚Äôs advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer‚Äôs corporate offices.</p>
<p>NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>A source in NAB told <em>Dawn</em> that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.</p>
<p>The remaining three properties ‚Äî Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi ‚Äî will be auctioned later.</p>
<p>No date has been announced yet for the next auction.</p>
<p>NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz‚Äôs son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.</p>
<p>Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1886822">¬£190m Al-Qadir Trust case</a> and the Bahria Town Karachi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1929117">case.</a></p>
<p>The auction followed the Islamabad High Court‚Äôs dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.</p>
<p>Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.</p>

                <h2>2 terrorists planning to attack police killed in Mianwali operation: CTD</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two terrorists planning to attack the police in Punjab‚Äôs Mianwali district were killed during an operation, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, ‚ÄúPunjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.‚Äù</p>
<p>It said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the statement, the CTD recovered ‚Äúexplosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets‚Äù from the terrorists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,‚Äù it said.</p>
<p>The CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.</p>
<p>Punjab CTD was ‚Äúdiligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism‚Äù, the statement added.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">ranked</a> second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>
<p>Last month, Punjab CTD killed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922297/5-terrorists-killed-as-punjab-ctd-foils-major-terror-attack-in-taunsa-sharif">five terrorists</a> and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a ‚Äúmajor counter-terrorism breakthrough‚Äù.</p>
<p>In April,  the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904191">10 terrorists</a> belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p></p>
