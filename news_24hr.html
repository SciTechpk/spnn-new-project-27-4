            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912760/army-chiefs-elevation-to-field-marshal-splits-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief’s elevation to field marshal splits PTI</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: There appears to be a split in the PTI over Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir’s promotion to the rank of field marshal, as its interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan felicitated the newly appointed field marshal as opposed to the incarcerated party founder, Imran Khan, who criticised the government’s move.</p>
<p>If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.</p>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan’s social media handler.</p>
<p>The PTI founder said it would have been more app­ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‘king’ as Pakistan was being run according to the ‘law of the jungle’. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, “there is only one king”.</p>
<p>The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. “I request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,” he said.</p>
<p><em>Dawn.com</em> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912592">quoted</a> him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. “This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,” he told reporters outside the jail as per <em>Dawn.com</em>.</p>

<p>“We have no strife with the military. Khan <em>sahib</em> also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,” he added.</p>
<p>PTI leader’s sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.</p>
<p>“We have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,” she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was “a law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king”, she added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the federal cabinet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912748/president-pm-decorate-coas-munir-with-rank-of-field-marshal">approved the promotion</a> of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‘Marka-i-Haq’.</p>
<p><strong>‘No deal’</strong></p>
<p>A post on Mr Khan’s X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.</p>
<p>It was “unfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law”.</p>
<p>The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.</p>
<p>It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.</p>
<p>As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi’s attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.</p>
<p><strong>Gandapur’s IMF warning</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.</p>
<p>Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue “in the best interest of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party’s founding chairman.</p>
<p>PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>“Such oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan’s spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks…because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,” he claimed.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912761/no-water-for-pakistan-from-indian-rivers-modi' target='_blank'><strong>No water for Pakistan from ‘Indian rivers’: Modi</strong></a>
            <p><p>• AGP Awan says Islamabad willing to discuss water sharing deal<br />
• Senate panel slams India’s ‘provocative action’</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075">suspend</a> a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.</p>
<p>The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>, responded that Islam­abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.</p>
<p>The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a> that killed 26 people.</p>
<p>New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den­ied and the nuclear-armed neig­hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.</p>
<p>“Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack … Pakistan’s army will pay it, Pakistan’s economy will pay it,” Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan’s finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have “any immediate impact”.</p>
<p>The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told <em>Reuters</em> that Pakistan is “willing to talk about or to address anything”.</p>
<p>He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.</p>
<p>The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.</p>
<p>“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.</p>
<p>The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.</p>
<p>“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet <em>NOS</em>.</p>
<p>“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Senate committee</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.</p>
<p>The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.</p>
<p>The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.</p>
<p>Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.</p>
<p>He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.</p>
<p>The committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.</p>
<p>“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.</p>
<p>It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911007/world-bank-president-says-no-provision-in-indus-waters-treaty-for-suspension">could not be held in abeyance</a> by one party and continued.</p>
<p>“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”</p>
<p>The members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.</p>
<p>This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.</p>
<p>The committee also condemned India’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909191/neelum-jhelum-hydropower-project-shelled-by-indian-forces-dg-ispr">attack</a> on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.</p>
<p>“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.</p>
<p>The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.</p>
<p>“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”</p>
<p>The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>However, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.</p>

            <p><p>• Meets IMF delegation, says country on road to economic progress<br />
• Govt seeks relief measures in budget; Fund reviewing proposals</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Amid week-long talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on next fiscal year’s budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912609">reaffirmed</a> Pakistan’s commitment to fast-track institutional reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>During a meeting with an IMF delegation led by Regional Director for the Middle East and South Asia, Jihad Azour, the prime minister said the country was now firmly on the path of economic development after a period of recovery and stability.</p>
<p>“By the grace of Allah, Pakistan is now moving from economic stability towards sustainable growth,” PM Shehbaz said in an official statement.</p>
<p>He said the government’s top priority was to sustain macroeconomic gains and expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.</p>
<p>The high-level meeting took place at the last leg of negotiations between an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909691">IMF staff mission</a> and Pakistan’s economic team to finalise next year’s budget in line with commitments made as part of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).</p>
<p>The Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.</p>
<p>The engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.</p>
<p>Sources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.</p>
<p>However, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.</p>
<p>During the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.</p>
<p>The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.</p>
<p><strong>PM meets WB team</strong></p>
<p>Separately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.</p>
<p>He hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.</p>
<p>Ms Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.</p>
<p>Also appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.</p>
