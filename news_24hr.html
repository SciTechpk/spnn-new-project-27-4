<p><em>Reuters</em> also reported projectiles landing in Haifa with explosions reported on impact, along with explosions reported in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Israeli army has issued a statement saying its air force is working to “intercept and strike wherever necessary” after missiles were launched from Iran a short while ago.</p>
<p>“The defence is not airtight, and therefore, it is imperative to continue following the instructions of the Home Front Command,” it said in a post on X.</p>

<p>Israel’s El Al Airlines announced on Sunday night that it suspended all flights until at least June 19, with additional cancellations to many European cities extending to June 23.</p>
<p>The Israeli flag carrier had earlier suspended all flights until June 17, with Israel’s airspace still closed.</p>
<p>“Once approvals are received from the relevant security and aviation authorities, we will do everything possible to allow as many Israelis as possible to return home, gradually resume our regular flight schedule and operate rescue flights from destinations near Israel,” El Al said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, US President Donald Trump called on the two foes to “make a deal”.</p>
<p>“Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make, in that case by using TRADE with the United States to bring reason, cohesion, and sanity into the talks with two excellent leaders who were able to quickly make a decision and STOP!” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114687664442020232" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Trump had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910785/fo-reiterates-support-for-trump-offer-to-resolve-kashmir-issue">offered</a> to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914608">ceasefire</a> between the two nuclear powers following their most intense <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">military confrontation</a> in decades.</p>
<p>In his social media post, Trump said that Iran and Israel will have peace “soon”, adding that there were many unspecified meetings happening and that the two countries should make a deal.</p>
<p>“We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran,” Trump said.</p>

<p>Following Friday’s strikes, Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-hits-iran-nuclear-facilities-missile-factories-as-tehran-vows-revenge#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20urged%20Iran%20to%20%E2%80%9Cmake%20a%20deal%E2%80%9D%2C%20warning%20that%20there%20will%20be%20more%20%E2%80%9Cdeath%20and%20destruction%E2%80%9D%20after%20Israel%20launched%20the%20deadly%20strikes.">urged Iran</a> to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched the deadly strikes.</p>
<p>While speaking to <a class="link--external" href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/middle-east-live-updates-israel-launches-preemptive-strike/?id=122797400" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>ABC</em></a>, Trump said “it’s possible [the US] could get involved” in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that the US is “not at this moment involved” in the conflict.</p>
<p>He also said he would be “open” to Russian President Vladimir Putin being a mediator. “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” Trump told <em>ABC</em>.</p>
<p>Later on Sunday, Iranian media reported explosions in the northeastern city of Mashhad.</p>
<p>“Two locations in Mashhad suffered explosions and fires,” <em>Fars</em> news agency reported, adding that “air defences were activated in the area”.</p>
<p>The <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said that blasts were heard near the city’s Shahid Hasheminejad Airport.</p>
<p>“No damage has been reported to the airport buildings or runway,” it added.</p>
<p>Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest site in Iran for Shia Muslims.</p>
<p>Israel’s military said its air force struck Mashhad airport. It added it was “the longest-range strike conducted since the beginning” of its attack on Iran, which began on Friday.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Trump in a phone call today that Ankara was ready to act as a facilitator to resolve the nuclear dispute which led to the conflict breaking out.</p>
<p>In a statement from his office, Erdogan welcomed Trump’s latest statement on a possible peace between Iran and Israel and urged his US counterpart to take action immediately to prevent a disaster “that could set the region on fire”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US’ virtual embassy in Tehran issued a <a class="link--external" href="https://ir.usembassy.gov/iran-security-alert-land-border-crossings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel advisory</a> urging Americans to not travel to Iran under any circumstances and recommending that US nations in Iran either depart immediately or shelter in place for extended periods.</p>
<p>“US citizens in Iran face serious, increasing dangers due to rising regional tensions,” the advisory warned. “The US government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran.”</p>
<p>The embassy informed that American nationals can cross into Armenia by land through the Agarak border crossing, which is open. It added that according to the Turkish government, border crossings at Gurbulak, Kapikoy and Esendere are open, but noted that the Iranian government may restrict movement by non-Turkish nationals.</p>
<p>The advisory added that Azerbaijan’s land borders remain closed, but US nationals may be able to enter via the Astara border crossing on June 15 with special authorisation.</p>
<p>“US citizens need approval from the Government of Azerbaijan before going to the border. US Embassy Baku must facilitate this,” it read. “US citizens that plan to request entry into Azerbaijan should send personal details (name, date of birth, passport information) and a photograph of their passport biodata page to the US Embassy Baku American Citizens Services Unit at <a href="mailto:BakuACS@state.gov">BakuACS@state.gov</a>.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran’s armed forces told residents of Israel to leave the vicinity of “vital areas” for their safety, in a video statement broadcast by state TV on Sunday evening around the time that Iran sent a new barrage of missiles towards Israel.</p>
<p>“We have a data bank of vital and critical areas in occupied territories (Israel) and call upon you not to let the brutal regime use you as human shields. Do not stay or travel near these critical areas,” an armed forces spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Trump vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> today.</p>
<p>“Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership,” said one of the sources, a senior US administration official.</p>
<p>The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said top US officials have been in constant communications with Israeli officials in the days since Israel launched its attack on Friday. They said that the Israelis reported they had an opportunity to kill Khamenei, but Trump waved them off of the plan.</p>
<p>The officials would not say whether Trump himself delivered the message, but he has been in frequent communications with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>When asked about <em>Reuters</em>’ report, Netanyahu, in an interview on <em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6374323669112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fox News</a></em> programme ‘Special Report With Bret Baier’ on Sunday said: “There’s so many false reports of conversations that never happened, and I’m not going to get into that.</p>
<p>“But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do, we’ll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States,” Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>The Israeli PM also said regime change in Iran could be a result of Israel’s military attacks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said that Iran would pay “a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children” during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Israeli army called on citizens to take shelter after detecting new missile launches from Iran toward Israel. However, Israel soon eased the air raid warning and said citizens could “leave protected spaces in all areas across the country.”</p>
<p>Two missile-like projectiles hit two locations in central Tehran, leading to explosions, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency reported on Sunday, saying the blast occurred near the central Valiasr Square.</p>
<p>Iranian media said an Israeli strike hit the Tehran police headquarters in the city centre.</p>
<p>“The Greater Tehran Police Command was hit by one of the enemy’s drones,” <em>ISNA</em> news agency reported, citing a police statement. It added that the attack caused “minor damage” and injured “a number” of police personnel.</p>

<p>President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran’s responses to Israeli attacks will be “more decisive and severe” if Israel’s hostile actions continue, according to state media. Pezeshkian added that Iran’s military has so far responded “strongly and appropriately”.</p>
<p>The Iranian president also urged Iraq to block Israel from using its airspace and territory to launch attacks on the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>“We emphasise that the Iraqi government must exercise greater vigilance and protection of its borders and airspace so that Iraqi territory is not misused against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Pezeshkian said in a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, according to the Iranian presidency website.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Tehran said Israel wanted to “drag the conflict to the Persian Gulf” after the latter attacked the world’s largest gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, igniting <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">another</a> round of deadly tit-for-tat missile barrages.</p>
<p>A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.</p>
<p>According to an Israeli government statement, at least 13 people have been killed and 380 hurt in Iran’s attacks on Israel, with children among those killed, <em>Al Jazeera</em> reported.</p>
<p>Of those wounded, nine are in serious condition while the rest have minor or moderate injuries. The statement also said 200 missiles and drones have been fired into Israel since the start of the fighting, with 22 places in the country affected.</p>
<p>Rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors.</p>

<p>Following the fresh exchange of missiles, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, adding its response had been based on self-defence.</p>
<p>Araghchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression, and that if this aggression stopped, Iran’s reactions would also cease.</p>
<p>The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar were a “blatant aggression and a very dangerous act”.</p>
<p>“Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,” he said.</p>

<p>The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-US <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1903561">nuclear talks</a>, which, according to him, could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916312">sixth round</a> of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.</p>
<p>“Israel’s attack would never have happened without the US green light and support,” Araghchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.</p>
<p>“It is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill.”</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/after-sitting-out-the-iran-attack-u-s-steps-in-to-help-israel-intercept-missiles-16749866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that the US military was “operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel”. “US jet fighters, Navy destroyers and ground-based air-defence systems had [been] positioned to help counter any attack”, it said, citing US officials.</p>
<p><em><a class="link--external" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/14/israel-iran-war-us-nuclear-program-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Axios</a></em> quoted a US official as saying that Israel has urged the Trump administration to join the war, but said currently the administration was not considering it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Israel’s Oil Refineries said its pipelines and transmission lines in Haifa had been damaged by missile strikes by Iran, according to a regulatory filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>It said that no injuries or casualties were reported at the sites, with refining facilities continuing to operate despite a shutdown of some downstream operations.</p>
<p>It said it is examining the impact of the damage on its operations and implications on its financial results.</p>
<p>Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies overnight, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.</p>
<p>Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.</p>
<p>It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.</p>
<p>The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.</p>
<p>Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.</p>
<p>So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.</p>

<p>Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, <em>Press TV</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/14/749850/Iran-IRGC-attack-Israel-fighter-jet-fuel-energy-sites-missiles-drones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.</p>
<p>The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbia Central Headquarters vowed that the Islamic Republic will keep conducting military operations against the Zionist regime vigorously to make the criminal enemy regret its aggression, <em>Tasnim</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/06/15/3335855/iran-s-operations-to-continue-unabated-until-israel-shows-remorse-senior-general" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In comments on Sunday, Major General Ali Shadmani underlined that Iran’s retaliatory military operations against the Israeli regime will continue relentlessly.</p>
<p>“The chain of military operations by the Iranian Armed Forces that have brought pride to the country will continue in a much more massive and harsh manner than the past until the criminal and aggressive Zionist enemy regrets what it did completely,” he stated.</p>
<p>Iran said it had <a class="link--external" href="https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1404/03/25/3335833/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-2-%D8%B9%D8%B6%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrested two individuals</a> it accused of being members of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Alborz province while they were preparing explosives and electronic devices, <em>Tasnim</em> reported today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.</p>
<p>The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274093/%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B4%DA%A9%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82%E2%80%8C%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%AA-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%85-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a televised address.</p>

<p>The Israeli military warned Iranians living near weapons facilities to evacuate, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks by Israel so far were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.</p>
<p>“The Israeli military will strike these sites and will continue to peel away the Iranian snake’s skin in Tehran and everywhere — targeting nuclear capabilities and weapons systems,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.</p>

<p>In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.</p>
<p>Iranians can seek shelter in mosques and schools during Israeli attacks, as well as subway systems, which will be open at all times from tonight, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>“There is no problem with the provision of food, medicine, fuel,” she added.</p>
<p>The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was <a class="link--external" href="https://snn.ir/fa/news/1274102/%D8%A2%D8%AA%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%B2%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%84-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under control</a>.</p>

<p>The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p>
<p>Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.</p>

<p>“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster <em>ARD</em> late on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”</p>
<p>“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”</p>
<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke to Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said on Sunday morning and both agreed it was important that the conflict in the Middle East should not escalate, a German government spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“The chancellor thanked (the sultan) for Oman’s mediation efforts towards ending Iran’s nuclear programme. He emphasised that Iran must never have nuclear weapons,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that both leaders underlined their willingness to help end the conflict through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>Tehran called off <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912795">nuclear talks</a> that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours">bombing</a>. Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.</p>

<p>Britain could potentially support Israel in its conflict with Iran, but the decision to send additional military jets to the Middle East was made mainly to protect British bases and personnel, British finance minister Rachel Reeves said today.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Sky News</em>, Reeves called for a de-escalation in the conflict and said the decision to send additional jets to the region was a “precautionary move”.</p>
<p>Asked if Britain would come to Israel’s aid if asked, Reeves said: “We have, in the past, supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in.”</p>
<p>She added: “We’re sending in assets to both protect ourselves and also potentially to support our allies.”</p>

<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#gas-field-attack" id="gas-field-attack" title="Permalink"></a>Gas field attack</h2>
<p>In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official <em>Tasnim</em> news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, <em>Tasnim</em> said.</p>
<p>Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.</p>
<p>Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.</p>
<p>An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.</p>

<p>With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.</p>
<p>B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.</p>
<p>Tehran has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916637/iran-threatens-to-target-us-bases-if-conflict-breaks-out">warned</a> Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.</p>
<p>Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916895">reported</a> it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917324/govt-hikes-petrol-price-by-rs480-diesel-by-rs795' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hikes petrol price by Rs4.80, diesel by Rs7.95</strong></a>
            <p><p>The Finance Division on Sunday night notified hefty increases in the prices of both petrol and diesel, with the rates climbing by Rs4.80 and Rs7.95 per litre, respectively.</p>
<p>According to a notification seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, the finance division stated that the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.</p>
<p>From June 16, high-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.</p>
<p>Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.</p>
<p>Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by ab­­­­out Re1 and Rs5 per lit­re, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.</p>
<p>Based on existing tax ra­­­­tes, informed sources said that the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go up by about Re1 per litre depending on final calculation on June 15, followed by a Rs5 per litre increase in HSD.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, under an iron-clad commitment with the International Monetary Fund, the government announced the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917014">imposition</a> of Rs77 per litre petroleum levy and Rs5 per litre carbon levy on furnace oil and Rs2.5 per litre charge on petrol and diesel from July 1.</p></p>

            <p><p>The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel has started affecting Balochistan, with the provincial government issuing orders on Sunday to close all borders and crossing points with Iran in Turbat, Panjgur and Gwadar for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>The development comes as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran earlier today, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq.</p>
<p>Israel <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/israel-launches-strikes-on-iran">launched</a> an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917041/irans-state-tv-says-heavy-and-destructive-attacks-against-israel-expected-within-hours#:~:text=New%20military%20brass%20appointed%20after%20commanders%20killed">commanders and scientists</a> and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denied</a>, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p>
<p>According to statements issued by deputy commissioners (DC) across the province today, the Balochistan government has closed all Iranian borders adjacent to the Gwadar district and imposed a ban on travel corridors due to the deteriorating situation in the region.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Gwadar DC’s office said, “In light of instructions from the Balochistan government, the Gwadar district administration has closed the corridor at the Gabd-Kalato 250 border until further notice.</p>
<p>“The public is requested to cooperate and contact the district administration for any information or guidance,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Panjgur district administration also closed all crossing points connected to Iran for an indefinite period, stating that this decision was taken as a precautionary measure due to the current regional security situation.</p>
<p>The announcement said that not only movement by foot through these routes been halted, but the delivery of fuel has also been completely banned.</p>
<p>The Panjgur DC maintained that these measures were taken due to “the possible uncertain situation in Iran and the security threats arising from international tensions”.</p>
<p>“The district administration has appealed to the public to fully cooperate with … in the current situation and avoid unnecessary movement in order to avoid any unexpected situation,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a post on X this afternoon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government was taking necessary measures for the welfare and safety of Pakistani nationals.</p>

<p>He noted that 450 Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> (pilgrims) had been evacuated from Iran yesterday. Arrangements have been made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.</p>
<p>“Our Embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani <em>zaireen</em> who are stranded due to the closure of airspace,” Dar said on X. “Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation.”</p>
<p>He noted that the Crisis Management Unit at the Foreign Office is operational 247 and can be contacted at:</p>
<p>+92 51-9207887  and <a href="mailto:cmu1@mofa.gov.pk">cmu1@mofa.gov.pk</a></p>
<p>“Our embassies in the region are closely coordinating all necessary efforts to support Pakistani nationals and <em>zaireen</em>,” Dar added.</p>
<p>Following Israel’s initial strikes, PM Shehbaz on Friday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916926/pm-shehbaz-orders-help-for-pakistani-zaireen-in-iran">directed</a> all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani pilgrims currently in Iran.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office also advised all pilgrims from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran Mudasir Tipu is currently in his home country for official meetings, the FO said.</p>
<p>“The embassy under the instructions of the foreign minister along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working to extend all possible facilitation to Pakistanis in Iran,” it added.</p>

<p>Dar received a telephone call on Sunday from Foreign Minister of Turkiye Hakan Fidan as both leaders expressed “deep concern and anguish over the deteriorating regional situation due to Israel’s unjustified attacks on Iran”.</p>
<p>He also confirmed his participation in the forthcoming meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM), and the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum’s (ICYF) ceremony both scheduled to be held next week in Istanbul.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz had earlier during a telephonic call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Pakistan’s presence in the events.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said Dar would represent Pakistan at the upcoming OIC CFM meeting in Istanbul. He also congratulated President Erdogan for being honoured by the ICYF. The OIC CFM is scheduled to take place in Istanbul from 21-22 June.</p></p>
