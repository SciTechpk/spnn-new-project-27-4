                <h2>2 dead, 11 injured as blast rips through market in Balochistan‚Äôs Qila Abdullah: Levies official</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two people were killed and at least 11 were injured after an explosion ripped through a market in Balochistan‚Äôs Qila Abdullah district on Sunday evening, a Levies official said.</p>
<p>According to the Qila Abdullah Levies Risaldar Gulab Khan, ‚ÄúThe blast took place near the Abdul Jabbar Market in the Gulistan area of Qila Abdullah district, resulting in the death of two people and injuries to 11 others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter the explosion, Levies personnel and people present at the scene immediately rescued the injured, who were then moved to the District Health Headquarters Chaman for treatment.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to the official, officers began an investigation after collecting evidence from the scene.</p>
<p>The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897969">Balochistan Liberation Army</a>, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.</p>
<p>In March, the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897419/jaffar-express-hijacking-state-media-reports-190-rescued-2nd-day-of-operation-underway-in-balochistan">Jaffar Express train</a> was hijacked near Balochistan‚Äôs Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p>

                <h2>‚ÄòWe will never bow down to Indian hegemony‚Äô, DG ISPR says</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said Pakistan ‚Äúwill never bow down to Indian hegemony‚Äù as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe truth is that India is not the US and Pakistan is not Afghanistan. India is not Israel and Pakistan is not Palestine. Pakistan will never be deterred. It can never be coerced.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will never bow down to Indian hegemony. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for regional peace and the world,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry <a class="link--external" href="https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/pakistan-ordu-sozcusu-chaudhry-aaya-konustu-asla-hint-hegemonyasina-boyun-egmeyecegiz/3572052" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> to <em>Anadolu Agency.</em></p>

    </figure></p>
<p>He argued that terrorism, extremism and hatred were India‚Äôs internal problems and that the New Delhi government was cracking down on groups including Muslims and Sikhs in the country, which was fuelling more anger, extremism and terrorism.</p>
<p>Earlier, the DG ISPR had said Pakistan is not a violent nation, reaffirming that the country‚Äôs top priority was peace as the recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a> with India holds.</p>
<p>New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">deadly attack</a> in occupied Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam. Pakistan had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906315">strongly denied</a> the allegations and called for a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack">neutral probe</a>. As the situation turned into a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">military confrontation</a> between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">ceasefire</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry told <em>RT Arabic</em> in an interview, according to <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/1923968916050657408" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PTV News</em></a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGreat and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan‚Äôs people is,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry‚Äôs spokesperson ‚Äúpersonally requested a ceasefire‚Äù. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?‚Äù the military spokesman was quoted as saying by <em>PTV News</em>.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the ‚Äútremendous work‚Äù done by diplomats by ‚Äúengaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,‚Äù the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi‚Äôs deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.</p>
<p>On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295">series of air strikes</a> in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials">downing five Indian jets</a> and later also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390">intercepted</a> dozens of its <a class="link--external" href="https://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drones</a>.</p>

<p>India then <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909839/india-targeted-nur-khan-airbase-murid-base-shorkot-base-but-all-paf-assets-safe-dg-ispr">attacked</a> Pakistani airbases and military targets on the night of May 9, prompting Pakistan to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">target its military installations</a> using missiles and airstrikes under ‚ÄúOperation Bunyanum Marsoos‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Recalling the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out">events of May 9-10</a>, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: ‚ÄúThe enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan‚Äôs nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>The military spokesperson stressed, ‚ÄúNot a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.‚Äù</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#india-rejected-logical-neutral-probe" id="india-rejected-logical-neutral-probe" title="Permalink"></a>‚ÄòIndia rejected logical neutral probe‚Äô</h2>
<p>During his conversation reported by <em>PTV News</em>, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was ‚Äúessential to look into its background‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,‚Äù the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan ‚Äúwithin minutes of the Pahalgam incident‚Äù, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?‚Äù Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,‚Äù the DG ISPR said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country‚Äôs sovereignty and borders,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would ‚Äúcontinue to do so at all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The DG ISPR reiterated the military‚Äôs stance that India was ‚Äúsponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndia is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the <em>khawarij</em> or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,‚Äù Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as <em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1849349#:~:text=TTP%20labelled%20as%20fitna">Fitna Al Khawarij</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last month, the military‚Äôs chief spokesperson had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">detailed</a> that a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India was arrested in Punjab‚Äôs Jhelum.</p></p>
