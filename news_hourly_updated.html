                <h2>ECP disqualifies Senate and NA opposition leaders, SIC chief, other PTI lawmakers</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday disqualified the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Sunni Ittehad Council chief Hamid Raza and other PTI lawmakers following their <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802">convictions</a> in cases related to the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1751782">arrest</a>, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1753254">attacking</a> the Lahore corps commander‚Äôs residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.</p>
<p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Faisalabad last week senten¬≠ced over 100 leaders and workers of the PTI, including several key opposition figures, to jail terms of up to 10 years in connection with the May 9 riots. Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz, MNA Zartaj Gul, Raza, Sheikh Rashid Shafique (nephew of former interior minister Sheikh Rashid), Kanwal Shauzab, Farah Agha, Rai Haider Kharal and Muhammad Ahmad Chattha were among those sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.</p>
<p>A notification from the ECP today said Faraz, Ayub, Kharal, Raza, MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, Gul, MPA Muhammad Ansar Iqbal, MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi and MPA Rai Muhammad Murtaza Iqbal were now disqualified under Article 63(1h) (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] ‚Ä¶ he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years) of the Constitution and their seats were vacant.</p>
<p>Ayub lambasted the ATC‚Äôs ‚Äúbogus verdict‚Äù in a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/OmarAyubKhan/status/1952737607013576874" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> on X today, saying that he would contest it and the ECP‚Äôs disqualification in court.</p>
<p>He also posted a video of himself at the Peshawar High Court with other PTI leaders and lawyers, saying the court had given him a few days and bail would be granted to him on filing his appeal.</p>

<p>The development follows other recent disqualifications of PTI leaders and lawmakers.</p>
<p>On July 29, the ECP had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927477/haste-raises-eyebrows-as-ecp-disqualifies-another-pti-lawmaker">disqualified MNA Abdul Latif</a> from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions were taken in recent days.</p>
<p>On July 28, the commission had <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202">disqualified</a> Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and MPA Ahmad Khan.</p>
<p>On December 21 and 26 last year, a military court had sentenced over 50 PTI leaders and activists, including Imran Khan‚Äôs nephew Hassaan Niazi, to up to 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>The ATCs have been hearing May 9-related cases daily to meet a deadline set by the Supreme Court for the conclusion of trials by August.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="http://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#faisalabad-atc-sentencing" id="faisalabad-atc-sentencing" title="Permalink"></a>Faisalabad ATC sentencing</h2>
<p>The ATC had convicted the PTI lawmakers under Section 109 (punishment for abetment) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in FIR No. 835/2023, registered at Ghulam Muhammadabad police station.</p>
<p>In FIR No. 1277/2023 of the same police station, 60 out of 67 accused were convicted, while seven were acquitted.</p>
<p>In FIR No. 832/2023, registered at the Civil Lines police station, 107 out of 108 accused were sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment while one person received a three-year sentence. The judge acquitted 77 accused in this case, stating that the prosecution had failed to establish charges against them.</p>
<p>Former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry, MNA Zain Qureshi (son of PTI‚Äôs Shah Mehmood Qureshi), MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro and Faizullah Kamuka were acquitted in all three FIRs.</p>
<p>The judge had issued arrest warrants for those convicted who were not present in court and had directed the police to arrest all convicts and bring them before the court for imprisonment.</p></p>

                <h2>Bangladesh to hold elections in February 2026: Yunus</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Bangladesh will hold elections in February 2026, interim leader Muhammad Yunus said on Tuesday, the first polls since a mass uprising <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">overthrew</a> the government last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the interim government, I will write a letter to the chief election commissioner requesting that the election be arranged before Ramazan in February 2026,‚Äù Yunus said in a broadcast on the one-year anniversary of the ousting of ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 85, is leading the caretaker government as its <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894">chief adviser</a> until elections, and has said he will step down after the vote.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will step into the final and most important phase after delivering this speech to you, and that is the transfer of power to an elected government,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Yunus had earlier said elections would be held in April, but key political parties have been demanding he hold them earlier and before the month of Ramazan.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI urge you all to pray for us so that we can hold a fair and smooth election, enabling all citizens to move forward successfully in building a ‚ÄòNew Bangladesh‚Äô,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the government, we will extend all necessary support to ensure that the election is free, peaceful and celebratory in spirit. ‚Äú</p>
<p>In an earlier address, he said: ‚ÄúTogether, we will build a Bangladesh where tyranny will never rise again.‚Äù</p>
<p>He paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFallen autocrats and their self-serving allies remain active,‚Äù however, he added, urging unity to protect the gains of the uprising while his government holds reform talks with political parties and civil society.</p>
<p>His interim government had launched sweeping reforms, he added, while trials for those responsible for the ‚ÄúJuly killings‚Äù were progressing swiftly.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Police were on high alert throughout the capital, with armoured vehicles patrolling the streets to deter any attempt by Hasina‚Äôs banned Awami League to disrupt the day‚Äôs events.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet this anniversary not be a day of retrospection, but a rallying cry for a brighter tomorrow,‚Äù Hasina said in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh, adding that she had never resigned from her duties as prime minister.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBangladesh has overcome adversity before, and we will rise again, stronger, more united, and more determined to build a democracy that truly serves its people.‚Äù</p>
<p>The July Declaration formally recognises the 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304">student-led uprising</a> and the shift away from authoritarian rule to democratic renewal.</p>
<p>Despite some opposition, it is backed by major political groups, including the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912466">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP), led by former premier Khaleda Zia.</p>
<p>Supporters see the charter as a foundation for institutional reform; critics have warned its impact could be largely symbolic in the absence of a legal framework or parliamentary consensus.</p></p>
