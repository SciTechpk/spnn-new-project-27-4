                <h2>Justice Naeem Afghan asks why PM being blamed after judges’ letter against agencies</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, a member of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB), has questioned why the offices of the president, prime minister and the law division are being dragged into the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893249">controversy</a> over the appointment of judges when <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028">allegations</a> had been levelled against intelligence agencies for interference in judicial affairs.</p>
<p>The observation came when senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, argued that the real reason behind the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1889123">transfer of three judges</a> to the IHC was the allegation levelled against intelligence agencies by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1824028">six IHC judges</a>.</p>
<p>In a joint letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council on March 25, 2024, the six judges had blamed intelligence agencies for meddling in judicial affairs.</p>
<p>In response to the argument by the senior lawyer, Justice Afghan asked if the allegations were attributed to the intelligence ag­­e­­ncies, why the three high offices were being dragged into the controversy to build a gro­und of malice. He also wondered if the intelligence agencies had demolished the en­­tire appointment procedure when they had no constitutional role in judges’ appointment.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Counsel alleges judges transferred to IHC for ‘extraneous collateral reasons’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a joint petition <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1893212">filed by five IHC judges</a> — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The counsel said the letter to the SJC triggered a reaction, as a bitter social media campaign against the judges ensued, whereby the degree of a signatory of the letter and the loyalty of another judge were questioned and cameras were allegedly installed in the bedroom of another judge.</p>
<p>He further alleged that this was a conspiracy contrived at the offices of the PM and law ministry to take over the control of IHC and if the president had also applied his mind to this effect, then the entire exercise fell within the category of malice in law.</p>
<p>Since direct proof of malice was always virtually impossible, malice was always drawn by inferences, he said.</p>
<p>At this, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan interjected to make a statement that during his 13-year career as a judge, he was never approached by any intelligence agencies. He also reminded the counsel that soon after the letter by IHC judges, full-court meetings were conducted in all high courts wherein it was resolved that no such interference by intelligence agencies had ever occurred and the problem confined to the IHC only.</p>
<p>Justice Hassan also noted that the allegations of malice against the office of the president and the members of the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan — a body that appoints judges — were very serious in nature.</p>
<p>In response, the counsel cited the example of Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui who was removed as IHC judge and later vindicated by the SJC and also cited interviews of certain government functionaries in the media.</p>
<p>At this, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar questioned if the constitutional bench was bound by the interviews or newspaper clippings.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The counsel recalled how JCP, while appointing two additional judges in IHC, deliberately left vacant three permanent offices of the judges in the high court. Since the JCP left three seats vacant, the president took it upon himself to fill these seats by invoking Article 200 when the authority to appoint permanent judges rests only with JCP.</p>
<p>According to the counsel, the Constitution does not contemplate filling of vacant seats by invoking Article 200, rather the article should be exercised only for a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Justice Mazhar asked both the counsel and Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan to come up with reasons on the part of the JCP to leave the three offices of the judges vacant while appointing two additional judges.</p>
<p>The counsel said, “A judge on the 16th position in seniority was imported from the Lahore High Court and put in place at the senior-most position in IHC”, adding that after the transfer of the three judges, the administrative and promotion committees of the IHC were also changed.</p>
<p>The transfer of the three judges to the IHC was not in the public interest, but done for extraneous collateral reasons, he alleged.</p>

                <h2>Over 5,000 Pakistani beggars deported from Saudi Arabia so far, NA informed</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia has deported a total of 5,033 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905327">Pakistani beggars</a> whereas another 369 individuals have been apprehended for begging in five other countries in the last 16 months.</p>
<p>This information was placed before the National Assembly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday in a written reply to a question asked by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sehar Kamran.</p>
<p>The official data provided by the minister shows that a total of 5,402 Pakistanis have been deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since January 2024. As many as 4,850 Pakistani nationals faced deportation from these countries in the year 2024 whereas 552 have returned to Pakistan this year.</p>
<p>The questioner has sought data of the last three years, but the minister provided details of the period starting from January 2024.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Another 369 individuals caught begging in five other countries; nearly 52pc deportees belong to Sindh; Pakistan has expelled over one million illegal Afghans</p>
</blockquote>

        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Interestingly, the province-wise break-up of the data shows that most of those deported from these countries belong to Sindh province. A total of 2,795 people from the province are among those deported from these countries on begging charges whereas the number of such people belonging to Punjab stands at 1,437.</p>
<p>According to statistics, as many as 1,002 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 125 from Balochistan, 33 from Azad Kashmir and 10 from Islamabad are among those deported from the six countries.</p>
<p>After Saudi Arabia, the highest number of 247 Pakistanis has been repatriated from Iraq. The UAE, which raised the issue with the Pakistan government more vigorously and imposed strict restrictions on visas for the Pakistani nationals, has so far deported 58 such individuals during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Afghan Refugees</strong></p>
<p>In response to another question asked by Anjum Aqeel Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the interior minister informed the National Assembly that over one million “illegal Afghans”, including those possessing Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), had been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906595">repatriated</a> since November 2023 under the Illegal Foreigner’s Repatriation Plan (IFRP).</p>
<p>“The IFRP has been approved by the federal government. Every sovereign state retains the right to deport illegal foreigners in order to safeguard its borders and national security.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are no international legal implications for Pakistan, as it is not a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol with respect to Afghan repatriation,“ says the minister in his written reply. He said Pakistan did not intend to extend the duration of ACC holders for further period.</p>
<p>He further said that 1.377 million Afghan refugees, holding POR (Proof of Registration) had been repatriated to Afghanistan through the UNHCR repatriation programme since 2007.</p>
<p>He said there were 813,146 Afghans with ACC and 1.304m POR holders in Pakistan at present.</p>
