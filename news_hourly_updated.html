                <h2>Budget 2025-26: Curbs placed on FBR‚Äôs arrest powers, assures Aurangzeb</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p><strong>‚Ä¢ Income tax for Rs50,000-Rs100,000 monthly salaries cut to 1pc<br />
‚Ä¢ Solar panel import tax slashed from 18pc to 10pc<br />
‚Ä¢ Opposition criticises lack of transparency on Senate finance committee report<br />
‚Ä¢ Shibli Faraz says economy running unsustainably on loans</strong></p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: Under fire from parliamentarians and business leaders over a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917564/budget-2025-26-guardrails-sought-to-stop-misuse-of-fbr-arrest-powers">clause allowing tax officers to detain suspected evaders</a>, Finance Minister Muha¬≠mmad Aurangzeb told the Senate on Saturday that more safeguards have been added to the law to prevent misuse of authority.</p>
<p>Speaking during the Senate debate on the Finance Bill 2025, Mr Aurangzeb said that detailed consultations were held with Senators Saleem Mand¬≠viwalla and Farooq H. Naek, resulting in clearer and more balanced provisions, which will be shared during his upcoming speech in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The rollback follows strong push-back from business lobbies and both parliamentary committees, which argued that the original clause ‚Äî allowing officers to detain suspects without external approval ‚Äî would lead to harassment.</p>
<p>For instance, in a letter to the finance minister earlier this week, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) voiced serious concerns over proposed amendments in the Finance Bill 2025-26 related to Section 37AA of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The chamber criticised the proposal for granting sweeping arrest and prosecution powers without proper checks and balances, warning that such measures could enable misuse of authority and lead to harassment of businesses.</p>
<p>Turning to relief measures, Mr Aurangzeb informed the Senate that income tax on individuals earning between Rs50,000 and Rs100,000 per month will be reduced to one per cent from the previously proposed 2.5pc.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis symbolic and practical step shows the state does not want to overburden this segment,‚Äù he said, expressing hope that the measure would increase disposable income and rebuild trust in the taxation system.</p>
<p>The minister also confirmed that the proposed 18pc tax on imported solar panels, aimed at supporting local manufacturers, has been lowered to 10pc. The tax will apply only to the 46pc of solar panel parts that are imported, which he said would result in a modest 4.6pc increase in prices.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb condemned reports of hoarding and profiteering ahead of the tax‚Äôs implementation, warning that legal action would be taken against those stockpiling imported panels to exploit consumers.</p>
<p>He insisted that the government had demonstrated ‚Äúseriousness and flexibility‚Äù in light of the discussions in both houses of parliament and the suggestions by lawmakers. Relief and social protection measures in the budget reflected the government‚Äôs sense of responsibility, he said, highlighting an increase in the Benazir Income Support Programme‚Äôs budget from Rs592 billion to Rs716bn.</p>
<p>He expressed the government‚Äôs commitment to take the country towards inclusive and sustainable economic growth, where everyone gets equal opportunities to make progress.</p>
<p>Regarding overall federal expenditure, the minister noted it would rise by only 1.9pc in the next fiscal year, compared to increases of 10pc to 12pc in previous years.</p>
<p>He hoped that, like the previous year, over 50pc of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee of Finance would be included in the final budget.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄòEconomy being run on loans‚Äô</strong></p>
<p>However, at the start of the proceedings, Leader of the Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz criticised the government for failing to share the committee‚Äôs final report, questioning how members could claim ownership of recommendations they had not seen.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have no idea how many of the recommendations we gave were included in the report,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He argued that the committee‚Äôs chair should come from the opposition to ensure proper oversight and lamented that the budget had imposed a heavier tax burden without cutting government spending.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe economy is being run on loans, which is unsustainable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe budget lacks vision, relies entirely on borrowing, proposes no new revenue streams and has no clear plan to reduce poverty.‚Äù</p>
<p>PTI parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar called for adhering to Article 73 of the Constitution. He was of the view that under the spirit of the Constitution, the recommendations of the Finance Committee should be shared with members at least a day in advance, so that they could thoroughly examine them before the stage of adoption of the report by the House.</p>
<p>He pointed out that presently, this article was not followed and the members were not given a report of the committee before the sitting. ‚ÄúThe responsibility under the article should be fulfilled as the Senate can only give recommendations for which its relevant committee does the exercise, but it can‚Äôt approve them. These are to be adopted by the House,‚Äù he said.</p>

                <h2>PTI leaders get relief from courts in Islamabad and Lahore</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD/LAH¬≠ORE: A court in Islamabad on Saturday acquitted several senior PTI leaders, including its chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, in two protest-related cases from last year, while in Lahore, former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was granted post-arrest bail in a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279">May 9, 2023</a>, riots case.</p>
<p>Islamabad Judicial Mag¬≠istrate Shahzad Ah¬≠med anno¬≠unced the verdict after reserving it earlier in the day, accepting the acquittal applications filed in case numbers 425 and 498 registered with the Karachi Company Police Station. The protest in question was organised on April 26, 2024, and moved from the office of PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen towards the Karachi Com¬≠pany, reportedly in violation of Section 144 and other legal provisions.</p>
<p>During the proceedings, PTI leaders Shoaib Shaheen and Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared before the court, while exemption pleas on behalf of Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub were submitted and duly accepted.</p>
<p>The defence counsel argued that the case had no legal basis as the FIRs were filed by unrelated parties and that eight individuals arrested at the scene had already been discharged during the investigation.</p>
<p>The magistrate questioned the non-appearance of co-accused Amir Dogar and Amir Mughal.</p>
<p>The defence requested the court to decide their cases on merit, similar to the other accused. The court was also informed that Murad Saeed, who had previously faced related charges, had been acquitted in other cases despite his prolonged non-appearance.</p>
<p>After hearing all arguments, the court acquitted Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, Ali Bukhari, Shoaib Shaheen, Malik Rafique, Amir Dogar, Amir Mughal and others.</p>
<p><strong>Bail for Qureshi</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore granted post-arrest bail to Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917568/cheema-granted-bail-in-shadman-police-station-attack-case">Shadman Police Station attack case</a> during the May 9 riots.</p>
<p>ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced a verdict reserved on the bail petition of Mr Qureshi and allowed the bail subject to surety bonds of Rs100,000.</p>
<p>The judge deferred till June 26 a decision on another bail petition of the PTI leader in a case relating to the burning of police vehicles near Lahore Corps Commander House.</p>
<p>Qureshi‚Äôs counsel had argued that the PTI leader was not even present in Lahore on May 9 ‚Äî the day of the alleged attack ‚Äî and was in Karachi with his wife for her medical treatment.</p>
<p>The counsel stated that the allegation of conspiracy against Mr Qureshi regarding the May 9 attacks was not proven. He said the petitioner should be granted bail, as many co-suspects in the same case had already been allowed bail.</p>
<p>Earlier, former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema also filed a bail petition in the same Shadman Police Station attack case.</p>
<p>The judge allowed the prosecution more time to present the record of the case and adjourned the hearing till June 24.</p>
