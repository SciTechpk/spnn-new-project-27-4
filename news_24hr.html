<p>GILGIT: Thousands of people, including foreign tourists, remai­ned stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925831">landslides</a>. Mobile and internet services across the region were also disrupted after fibre optic cables were damaged in several areas.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq confirmed that KKH is blocked at Achar Nallah in the Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Thousands of passengers, including tourists, travelling to and from GB are stranded on both sides of the highway.</p>
<p>He said that while KKH has been reopened for traffic within GB, restoration work is underway in Kohistan. The Babusar Pass Road is also blocked at several locations.</p>
<p>Mr Faraq assured that all tourists stranded on the Babusar route have been safely evacuated and search operations for missing individuals are underway. Those rescued from Babusar Pass have been brought to Chilas, where local hoteliers and government authorities have arranged complimentary accommodation.</p>
<p>The mobile and internet communication systems in the region were severely damaged, leaving the majority of residents without service for up to six hours on Wednesday. The region’s communication system relies on an optical fibre cable connecting GB with Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>According to the Special Commu­nications Organisation (SCO), recent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925666">flash floods</a> in Babusar Valley caused significant damage to the main optical fibre cable. Emergency alternative satellite arrangements were made, but consumers faced slow mobile and internet connectivity. Mr Faraq said that work has begun to restore the communication system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Sadia Danish expressed concern over the safety of 40 individuals stranded in Danyore’s Manogah Nallah in Gilgit. In a statement, she urged the government to initiate a helicopter rescue operation immediately.</p>
<p>Ms Danish emphasised tha protecting human lives should remain the top priority and recognised the efforts of the provincial government, the Pakistan Army, volunteers and residents in the rescue operations during the flood emergency.</p>
<p>She also commended the generosity of residents, who opened their homes, mosques, imambargahs and hotels to shelter stranded tourists.</p>
<p>Moreover, river erosion caused the collapse of the Hotu suspension bridge in Shigar, cutting off the only access to the K2 base camp. A large number of foreign expedition members and trekkers were stranded, while eight villages were also disconnected.</p>
<p>Officials from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that a C130 sortie will be arranged from Gilgit to Islamabad to airlift stranded travellers.</p>
<p>Stranded tourists are expected to receive airlifts free of charge on Thursday (today) in an operation overseen by Gilgit’s additional deputy commissioner.</p>
<p>GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has assured that the rescue operations will continue until all stranded people in Babusar are rescued.</p>
<p>He also declared the flood-affected areas of Thaki, Niyat, Khunra and Thor in Diamer as disaster zones. He also announced that the families of those who died in the floods at Babusar will receive death compensation under the government policy.</p>
<p>The chief minister ordered urgent measures to restore drinking water, electricity, irrigation channels and road communications in the flood-affected areas of Thor. He also visited the flood-affected areas to oversee the recovery efforts along with Adviser on Forests Haji Shah Baig and GB Minister for Agriculture Engineer Anwar.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926158/pakistani-passport-still-ranked-among-weakest-despite-improvement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport still ranked among ‘weakest’ despite improvement</strong></a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: While the passports of other Asian countries have emerged as the most powerful in the world, Pakistan’s travel document continues to be ranked among the ‘weakest’ in the world, with visa-free access available to only 32 destinations.</p>
<p>According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1847754">fourth-worst</a> in the world for the fourth consecutive year.</p>
<p>The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote-level-1">
<p>Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.</p>
<p>Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.</p>
<p>The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.</p>
<p>Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.</p>
<p>India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.</p>
<p>The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.</p>
<p>Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926220/columbia-university-to-pay-over-200m-to-resolve-trump-probes' target='_blank'><strong>Columbia University to pay over $200m to resolve Trump probes</strong></a>
            <p><p>Columbia University said on Wednesday it will pay $200 million to the US government after President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915741">threatened to pull</a> federal funding over what he said was its unwillingness to protect Jewish students.</p>
<p>In a sweeping deal that will restore the prestigious New York institution’s federal monies, Columbia has pledged to obey rules that bar it from taking race into consideration in admissions or hiring, among other concessions.</p>
<p>“Columbia University has reached an agreement with the United States government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws,” <a class="link--external" href="https://president.columbia.edu/content/our-resolution-federal-government" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement said</a>, adding that the $200m would be paid over three years.</p>
<p>The university will also pay $21m to settle investigations brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it said.</p>
<p>“Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The promise of the federal funding spigot reopening offers relief for the university, which was under growing financial pressure, despite a comfortable endowment and a reputation it can bank on.</p>
<p>The agreement also represents a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly claimed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912827">elite universities</a> brainwash students against his nationalist ideas with left-wing bias.</p>
<p>Thanking Columbia for “agreeing to do what is right,” Trump warned in a social media post that “numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust… are upcoming.”</p>
<p>The centuries-old Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also in a fight with the administration over Trump’s threats to rip away federal funding, and Wednesday’s carefully worded agreement — in which Columbia admitted no wrongdoing — could offer a framework for future deals.</p>
<p>“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said.</p>
<p>“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.</p>
<p>“Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#disciplinary-actions" id="disciplinary-actions" title="Permalink"></a>Disciplinary actions</h2>
<p>Under the settlement, Columbia will maintain a security force to prevent <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1192400">demonstrations</a> in academic spaces, such as those that rocked the campus last year when pro-Palestinian protestors clashed with law enforcement and occupied university buildings.</p>
<p>The school also agreed to “promptly provide” federal authorities with any requested information on “disciplinary actions involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia is aware of for criminal activity, including trespass or other violation of law.”</p>
<p>Columbia found itself at the centre of a firestorm last year over <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1828969">claims of anti-Semitism</a> triggered by campus protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>Some Jewish students claimed they were intimidated and that authorities did not act to protect them.</p>
<p>The school announced a wave of various student punishments on Tuesday, including expulsions and degree revocations, against nearly <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1926027">80 students</a> involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement that has called on the university to divest from Israel.</p>
<p>“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community,” Columbia said <a class="link--external" href="https://communications.news.columbia.edu/news/university-statement-ujb-determinations-butler-library-disruption-and-alumni-weekend" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a statement</a> about student protests on its campus.</p>
<p>“Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”</p>
<p>While the university appears to be acquiescing to the Trump administration’s demands to quash student protest, one of the most prominent leaders of the US pro-Palestinian campus protests is still raising his voice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1919637">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate active in campus demonstrations, has sued the Trump administration for $20m over his arrest and detention by immigration agents.</p>
<p>Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who is married to a US citizen, missed the birth of his son while being held in a federal immigration detention centre in Louisiana.</p>
<p>He called the lawsuit a “first step towards accountability.”</p></p>
