            <p><p>Two government delegations are set to hold a series of meetings with major world capitals to present Pakistan’s perspective to the global community on the recent spike in tensions with India, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914873">high-level team</a> — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the FO said in a <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/visits-of-high-level-delegations-to-important-capitals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.</p>
<p>Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.</p>
<p>The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.</p>
<p>Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, <a class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/statement-by-the-spokesperson-regarding-media-queries-related-to-visits-of-high-level-delegations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according</a> to the FO.</p>
<p>During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.</p>
<p>“The visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan’s perspective on the recent Indian aggression,” the FO statement read.</p>
<p>“The delegations will highlight Pakistan’s responsible and restrained conduct — seeking peace with responsibility — in the face of India’s reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.”</p>
<p>The delegations will also highlight that “dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation”.</p>
<p>The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.</p>
<p>“The delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,” the FO said.</p>

<p>Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a “packed schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York”.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">

    </figure></p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://ppp.org.pk/pr/33976/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be “mere photo opportunities”.</p>
<p>She added that the country’s status as “a responsible and stable middle power” is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in “regional peace and security”.</p>
<p>“Adherence to international laws is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Rehman said, adding that the “fabricated” Indian narrative against the country “will not be allowed to take the form of truth this time”.</p>
<p>“India has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,” she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian “film script”.</p>
<p>The PPP leader said, “Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan’s solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.</p>
<p>“Pakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,” she added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Headline inflation rose 3.5 per cent year-on-year in May 2025, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Monday.</p>
<p>On a month-on-month basis, it decreased by 0.2pc in May as compared to a decrease of 0.8pc in the previous month, according to data.</p>
<p>This was higher than the finance ministry’s expectations, which had <a class="link--external" href="https://1914180" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anticipated</a> inflationary outlook to “remain between 1.5-2.0pc in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0pc by June”.</p>
<p>The finance ministry had depicted a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), presenting a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.</p>
<p>Topline Securities, in a note, said that inflation during 11MFY25 had averaged at 4.61pc compared to 24.52pc in 11MFY24.</p>

            <p><p>The Karachi police on Monday arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen in the city’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).</p>
<p>The development came after a video of the incident went viral on social media earlier today, prompting authorities to take notice of it.</p>
<p>The man, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said in a statement.</p>
<p>The man, travelling in a luxury car, allegedly subjected a bike rider, who was accompanied by a woman, to torture on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad road after a minor accident.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the police had arrested the suspect’s driver and guard during late-night raids on his home and office in DHA. DIG Raza clarified that the held suspect was not a government employee.</p>
<p>Stating that the citizen who was subjected to violence had not approached the police to file a complaint, the DIG said the police were trying to contact his family.</p>
<p>“The police are taking this issue extremely seriously,” said the South police chief, adding that a first information report (FIR) has been registered against the suspect and an investigation has been launched.</p>
<p>DIG Raza asserted that no one was above the law and vowed to promise “complete justice” to the aggrieved citizen.</p>
<p>“The suspects involved in the torture would be brought to justice and all requirements of justice would be fulfilled. The law is equal for all, and there is no exception,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho directed the South senior superintendent of police to submit a detailed report on the incident.</p>
<p>They further ordered him to take action against the culprits, as no one was above the law.</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897713">road rage incident</a> in Lahore in March, armed guards of a private security company reportedly fired shots at a car rider at Dharampura Underpass, thrashed him and fled the scene, leaving a vehicle and some weapons on the spot.</p></p>
