                <h2>Four ‚ÄòRAW agents‚Äô arrested, weapons seized in Karachi‚Äôs Quaidabad raid, police say</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>KARACHI: Four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in the Quaidabad area, police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Special Investigation Unit of the Sindh police and an intelligence agency conducted the raid on a tip-off, SIU SSP Mohammed Shoaib Memon said, adding that they had links with the Indian intelligence agency ‚Äî the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).</p>

<p>He identified the suspects as Mohammed Khan alias Gullu, Yameen Malah, Akhter Thaheem and Ghulam Qadir alias Akash, and claimed that they were found involved in espionage activities.</p>

<p>With their arrest, a plot to carry out terror attacks in the country was foiled, he said.</p>

<p>SSP Memon said that two hand grenades, a Kalashnikov, a rifle, two pistols and mobile phones were seized from them. The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country‚Äôs sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,‚Äù the SIU officer claimed.</p>

<p>According to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.</p>

<p>They received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies‚Äô personnel, the SSP said.</p>

                <h2>American investors urged to explore mineral sector</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik on Wednesday urged American investors and companies to explore Pakistan‚Äôs vast mineral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905497">wealth</a> through public-private partnerships and joint ventures.</p>
<p>Speaking at a webinar titled ‚ÄúOpportunities in Pakistan‚Äôs Mining Sector ‚Äì Unlocking Mineral Potential‚Äù, the minister highlighted the country‚Äôs rich endowment of mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals vital for the global energy transition.</p>
<p>The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Energy and the US Embassy in Pakistan to promote investment opportunities in the country‚Äôs minerals and mining sector.</p>
<p>Mr Malik assured that both the Government of Pakistan and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are fully committed to facilitating international companies seeking to partner in unlocking Pakistan‚Äôs mineral reserves.</p>
<p>He emphasised Pakistan‚Äôs growing role in the global shift towards clean energy, citing the nation‚Äôs abundant reserves of critical minerals as a key enabler of a green transition. ‚ÄúRenewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,‚Äù he stated.</p>

<p>The minister underscored the international significance of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900381">Reko Diq copper-gold project</a>, while also referencing recent discoveries in Balochistan‚Äôs Chaghi district and KP‚Äôs Waziristan region.</p>
<p>Mr Malik lauded the success of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902833">Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025</a> (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and global attention. ‚ÄúPMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,‚Äù he remarked.</p>
<p>US Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires Natalie Baker reaffirmed the strong economic ties between the US and Pakistan. ‚ÄúPakistan offers immense opportunities in the minerals sector. With one of the world‚Äôs largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq, and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Ms Baker welcomed Pakistan‚Äôs recent policy initiatives aimed at unlocking the sector‚Äôs potential and pledged continued support from the US Embassy in facilitating American businesses. ‚ÄúWe are here to foster connections and build win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan‚Äôs development, and we see great promise in this sector,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>She concluded by reaffirming the US government‚Äôs commitment to supporting Pakistan‚Äôs economic development and strengthening bilateral economic ties. ‚ÄúWe believe in Pakistan‚Äôs potential and see shared opportunity in its journey toward inclusive, sustainable growth,‚Äù she said. The webinar was broadcast from the head office of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and brought together senior officials from the Ministry of Energy, leading mineral and energy firms, SIFC representatives, US diplomats, and energy sector stakeholders.</p>
