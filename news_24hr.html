            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910733/11-soldiers-martyred-78-wounded-while-defending-pakistan-in-indian-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 soldiers martyred, 78 wounded while defending Pakistan in Indian attack: ISPR</strong></a>
            <p><p>At least 11 soldiers were martyred and 78 wounded while defending Pakistan against India’s “unprovoked and reprehensible dastardly attacks” during the recent escalation between the neighbours, said the military’s media wing in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan under the banner of Operation Sindoor, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">announced</a> that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Army include Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar and Sepoy Nisar, as per the statement.</p>
<p>The martyrs from the Pakistan Air Force include Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.</p>
<p>“Pakistan Armed Forces mounted a resolute response under the banner of Marka-i-Haq, delivering precise and notch-up retributive strikes through Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, stated the ISPR in its statement.</p>
<p>“Their noble sacrifice of martyrs is an enduring symbol of courage, devotion, and unwavering patriotism — etched forever in the nation’s memory,” the statement said. “Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the martyred civilians and military personnel, the ISPR offered heartfelt prayers for the recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>“Let there be no ambiguity: any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty or territorial integrity, ever again, shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response,” the statement read while reaffirming that the nation “remains resolute in the face of aggression.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz Sharif has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910450/nation-celebrates-befitting-response-to-aggression">announced</a> that Youm-e-Marka-i-Haq will be observed every year on May 10 on the “magnificent success” of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Friday, May 16, 2025, will be observed as a day to pay tribute to the armed forces for achieving magnificent success on the defence front and to bow before God in gratitude, he added.</p></p>

            <p><p>Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday vowed that the provincial government will make education a “top priority” in the upcoming budget and allocate more resources towards the sector, state-run <em><a class="link--external" href="https://radio.gov.pk/13-05-2025/more-funds-to-be-allocated-for-education-sector-in-upcoming-budget-kp-cm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Radio Pakistan</a></em> reported.</p>
<p>The chief minister’s concerns follow in the wake of the unexpected <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910614/shortage-of-books-troubles-students-teachers-in-kp">textbook shortage</a> in the province which has disrupted classes, high dropout rates, and Pakistan’s “low” ranking in the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">District Education Performance Index Report 2020-23</a>.</p>
<p>“Presiding over a meeting in Peshawar, he directed measures to enhance teachers’ capacity, ensure 100 per cent merit in new recruitments, and establish schools in rented buildings in areas where they are urgently needed,” the report said.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was decided that comprehensive and multi-faceted measures would be taken to increase student enrollment in schools. In this regard, schemes would be included in the upcoming budget to support various activities.</p>
<p>“Gandapur expressed concern that in some districts,  the rate of out-of-school children remains alarming, and the declaration of an education emergency is a necessary step to reduce this number and improve enrollment rates,” it added.</p>
<p>The chief minister emphasised strengthening the monitoring system and taking steps to provide missing facilities such as laboratories, examination halls, and other essential infrastructure in existing schools.</p>
<p>During the last two decades, students received books from the provincial government free of charge at the start of the scholastic year in April.  Two years ago, the government decided to deliver only half of the required books as the costs reached over Rs10 billion, directing the schools’ administration to collect old books from the students promoted to the next grades and fulfil the remaining book requirements.</p>
<p>This year, however, a complex situation has emerged in schools as the textbook board claims that it has printed all the books requested by the education department but students and teachers have complained about a shortage of books.</p>
<p>In August last year, an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854348">official report</a> placed the country’s education system in the ‘low’ performance category and highlighted critical areas requiring attention to improve education outcomes.</p></p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910779/junaid-akbar-submits-resignation-as-pac-chairman-to-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Junaid Akbar submits resignation as PAC chairman to PTI</strong></a>
            <p><p>PTI MNA Junaid Akbar on Tuesday said he had handed over his resignation as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to the party.</p>
<p>The development came after it emerged that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had directed Akbar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910714">to resign</a> from the position and focus on provincial matters.</p>
<p>In a video statement issued today, Akbar confirmed that he had handed over his resignation to PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that he readily accepted the decision of the party and Imran.</p>
<p>“Whatever the decision of the party and the decision of Imran Khan, I will not think for a moment and will readily accept it,” he said.</p>
<p>Akbar said the position was a responsibility given by the party and he would accept any decision by the PTI founder, including handing over the party presidency or resignation from the assembly.</p>
<p>PTI’s central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, had confirmed to <em>Dawn</em>, that Akbar would step down as PAC chairman. He said Imran had conveyed the message through his sister Aleema Khan during their last meeting and announced that Akbar would be replaced by Omar Ayub Khan. He said Aleema conveyed the message to Salman Akram Raja after coming out of Adiala Jail.</p>
<p>Akbar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1887487">elected unopposed</a> as chairman of the PAC in January this year. In the same month, he was appointed by Imran as the president of PTI’s KP chapter, replacing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.</p>
<p>The position had been vacant since the February 2024 general elections, which brought the PML-N government to power. The PAC chairmanship is usually held by the leader of the opposition or their nominee, though there is no legal requirement for this parliamentary tradition.</p>
<p>After the general elections, the PTI made several U-turns over nominating a candidate for the post of PAC chairman. Sher Afzal Marwat was initially nominated, followed by the names of Akram and Omar. Ultimately, Akbar’s name was finalised for the post.</p></p>
