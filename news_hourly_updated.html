            </a>
            <p><p>Security forces eliminated two ‚ÄúIndia-backed‚Äù terrorists after an attack on government offices in Balochistan‚Äôs Mastung district that killed a teenager and injured seven others on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896269">intensified</a> their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1882568">key perpetrator</a> of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTwo terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,‚Äù Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Fitna al Hindustan</em> attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists‚Äô firing,‚Äù the statement read.</p>
<p>The term ‚Äú<em><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357#:~:text=state%2Dsponsored%20proxies%20of%20India%20(Fitna%20al%20Hindustan)">Fitna al Hindu¬≠stan</a></em>‚Äù is a new phrase coined by Pakistan‚Äôs military, aimed at framing India‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1907471">alleged role</a> in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,‚Äù Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces ‚Äúencircled‚Äù the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to <em>Dawn.com</em>, adding, ‚ÄúHeavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.‚Äù</p>

<p>Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an ‚Äúorganised‚Äù clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.</p>
<p>It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to ‚Äúprotect citizens and arrest terrorists‚Äù was based on intelligence input, Rind said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,‚Äù the government official highlighted.</p>

<p>Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914847/militant-attacks-increased-to-85-in-may-pakistan-institute-for-conflict-and-security-studies">released</a> by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.</p>
<p>In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan‚Äôs Khuzdar was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912357">targeted</a> on May 21, leaving eight children among <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913363">10 dead</a>.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1904388">three policemen</a> were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung‚Äôs Dasht Road.</p>
<p>Last month, security forces killed two ‚ÄúIndian sponsored terrorists‚Äù in Balochistan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr">Duki district</a> and another two in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915835">Kachhi</a>.</p>

<p>On June 18, a man and a woman were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918035">shot dead</a> when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1802262">uptick</a> in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p>
<p>The country ranked <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1896075/pakistan-rises-to-second-in-global-terrorism-index">second</a> in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p>

                <h2>Govt to deploy FC troops at Fazl‚Äôs residence in DI Khan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The federal government has decided to deploy Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel outside the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Dera Ismail Khan city due to security concerns, it emerged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a letter dated June 29 to the FC commandant in Peshawar, the interior ministry issued orders to deploy ‚Äúone platoon‚Äù of FC personnel at the residence of the JUI-F chief ‚Äúto avoid any untoward situation‚Äù.</p>
<p>The decision has been taken on the prime minister‚Äôs directives for security purposes and recent incidents involving the JUI-F‚Äôs chief son, Asjad Mahmood.</p>
<p>Earlier last month, Mahmood‚Äôs vehicle was intercepted on the main highway by armed men when he was on his way from DI Khan to Lakki Marwat.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Fazl‚Äôs residence in Islamabad and expressed concern over the alleged attack and attempted kidnapping of the JUI-F chief‚Äôs son, state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://www.radio.gov.pk/20-06-2025/pm-vows-to-bring-asjad-mahmoods-attackers-to-justice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>The prime minister expressed deep concern over the assault and foiled kidnapping attempt on Mahmood and inquired about his health, according to a statement from the PM‚Äôs Media Office.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz issued immediate directives to arrest those involved in the attack and ensure swift legal action.</p>
<p>JUI-F leaders have come under attack in recent years in Balochistan and KP. On May 15, a powerful explosion <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911191">targeted</a> the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah near a seminary in South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Police said the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed. The JU-F leader was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.</p>
<p>On April 25, a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906374/jui-f-leader-among-three-killed-in-kalat-blast">local leader</a> of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.</p>
<p>The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.</p>
<p>On March 14, a bomb <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1897859">exploded</a> at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>In another incident on March 2, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1895225">two leaders</a> of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in Zehri area of Khuzdar district.</p></p>
