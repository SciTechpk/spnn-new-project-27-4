                <h2>Four tourists killed, 15 missing as rains lash Gilgit-Baltistan</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• Hundreds rescued, many sheltered by locals; eight tourist vehicles swept away by floods<br />
• Portion of KKH damaged<br />
• Houses, schools, crops, orchards damaged<br />
• PDMA issues river alert for Punjab</p>
<p>GILGIT: At least four tourists were killed, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area in Diamer district on Monday.</p>
<p>The devastating impacts of <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1906375">climate cha­nge</a> became more visible in Gilgit-Balt­istan as a cloudburst-induced flood wreaked havoc across the region.</p>
<p>GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said the flood washed away eight tourist vehicles in the Thak area. He confirmed that at least 15 tourists are missing, with four bodies, including that of a woman from Lodhran (Punjab), recovered so far. The injured and deceased have been shifted to a local hospital.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that the Babusar Highway was also blocked.</p>
<p>Communication and electricity infrastructure have been disrupted in the area. Mr Faraq said hundreds of stranded tourists have been rescued, while many have been given shelter by local residents.</p>
<p>Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told <em>Dawn</em> that the situation is alarming due to the high intensity of the flood. He said the flood’s path stretched about seven kilometres. At least three tourist vehicles were seen being washed away.</p>
<p>He estimated that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.</p>
<p>Rescue teams are working to trace them, though operations are hampered by continued mudflow.</p>
<p>The flood also damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides. Meanwhile, Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister has directed authorities to utilise all available resources to rescue and assist those affected. Agricultural land, crops, trees, public and private property, and infrastructure have suffered extensive damage.</p>
<p><strong>Floods hit Ghizer</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, flash floods caused by cloudbursts also created disasters in multiple areas of the Ghizer district. Local administration officials reported that the villages of Kanche and Salpi were particularly hard-hit, with over a dozen homes, agricultural lands, standing crops, and basic infrastructure destroyed.</p>
<p>In Yasin’s upper Thui area, brief rainfall on Saturday night triggered a flash flood that severely damaged residential houses and a private educational institution.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Six homes were completely destroyed, and several others — including a school run by the Aga Khan Education Service — were partially damaged. Large areas of wheat fields, as well as apricot and cherry orchards, were also ravaged.</p>
<p>Flood victims have appealed to the government for immediate assistance.</p>
<p>In Skardu, Rescue 1122 has placed Gamba station on high alert due to the rising flood threat in Bargi and Sadpara nullahs.</p>
<p>The floods damaged public and private property, agricultural land, and roads, and entered residential homes.</p>
<p>Drinking and irrigation water channels were also damaged.</p>
<p>Baltistan Commissioner Kamal Khan visited the area and mobilised machinery for restoration of water supply and roads.</p>
<p>Administration officials said rising water levels in the Khunjerab river have damaged the KKH at Passu in Gojal, threatening to sever upper valleys from rest of the region and cut off Pakistan’s only road link to China via Khunjerab Pass.</p>
<p>Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEP) Director Khadim Hussain told <em>Dawn</em> that Gilgit-Baltistan has <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922323">experienced</a> record temperature this year.</p>
<p>“High temperatures and humidity have persisted for over a month and a half. These conditions are triggering frequent cloudbursts across the region,” he said.</p>
<p>He explained that cloudbursts are causing severe flash floods in the mountainous terrain, where mud and rockslides intensify downstream destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Rains lash Mansehra</strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, the monsoon downpour, which began in the afternoon, continued across Mansehra, Torghar, Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai-Palas for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Link roads in Kaghan, Siren, and Konsh valleys of Mansehra and various parts of Torghar were blocked due to landslides triggered by the rains.</p>
<p><strong>PDMA alert for Punjab</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday issued a flood alert for the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers, warning of medium to high-level flows due to heavy rainfall expected between July 21 and 23.</p>
<p>According to PDMA’s latest Daily Situation Report, the Indus River at Taunsa is currently at a medium flood level with inflows of 429,200 cusecs.</p>
<p>PDMA has directed the commissioners of Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Lahore, Sahiwal, and Bahawalpur, along with the deputy commissioners of multiple districts including Jhelum, Gujrat, Lahore, and Faisalabad, to take immediate action and implement precautionary measures.</p>

                <h2>Senate finally becomes whole after KP polls</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>• Ruling PTI gets six, opposition alliance secures five seats as per agreed formula<br />
• KP lawmakers allege ‘vote-swapping’ by party leadership to keep members in line<br />
• PML-N nominee bags Punjab seat in by-election</p>
<p>PESHAWAR: After more than 17 months, the Senate finally became whole on Monday as Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa Asse­mbly, following the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925431">oath-taking</a> of lawmakers on reserved seats, elected 11 members to the upper house of parliament under a seat-sharing formula inked between the PTI government and the opposition alliance.</p>
<p>As per the arrangement which had been initially opposed by several PTI lawmakers, six seats went to the ruling party and five to the opposition parties, including two each to the PPP and the JUI-F and one to the PML-N.</p>
<p>The election witnessed a 17-month delay due to litigation over reserved seats, which was finally settled with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920721/ptis-hopes-dashed-as-rivals-set-to-receive-reserved-seats">decision</a> of the Constitutional Bench last month, followed by the ‘controversial’ oath-taking of members on Sunday. The final result was in line with the seat adjustment deal, agreed between the PTI government and the opposition parties.</p>
<p>For the election, six PTI nominees, five opposition picks, and one PTI dissident were in the running. Initially, five disgruntled PTI candidates were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1925557">vying</a> for the Senate seats, but Irfan Saleem, Mohammad Waqas Ora­kzai, Syed Irshad Hus­sain, and Aisha Bano withdrew after the party leadership convinced them that their candidacy would harm the party.</p>
<p>According to Form-58 released individually to the winning candidates by the returning officer, the ruling PTI won six seats: four general seats and one seat each for women and technocrats. Similarly, the opposition got five senate seats: three general and one each reserved for women and technocrats. PTI winners on the general seats included Murad Saeed with 26 votes, Mirza Afridi with 21 votes, Faisal Javed with 22 votes, and Noorul Haq Qadri with 21 votes. Azam Swati and Robina Naz won the reserved seats with 89 votes each.</p>
<p>PPP’s Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed of the PML-N, and JUI-F nominee Attaul Haq received 18 votes each on general seats, while the technocrat and woman seat respectively went to PPP’s Robina Khalid and Dilawar Khan of the JUI-F. Ms Khalid got 52 votes and Mr Khan got 54 votes.</p>
<p><strong>Vote-swapping allegations</strong></p>
<p>The polling was scheduled to start at 11am; however, it started at 11:26am and ended at 5pm. All 145 members of the KP Assembly polled their votes in an exercise inside the assembly, which was restricted to media persons. Out of 145 polled votes for the general seats, two were declared invalid. Similarly, four and two votes were also declared invalid for seats of women and technocrats, respectively.</p>
<p>Several ruling and opposition members, on the condition of anonymity, told <em>Dawn</em> that their leadership allegedly relied on ‘vote-swapping’ to keep their members in check. This involves the party heads, or their nominees, marking the ballots for them in return for a blank ballot, to ensure that their members do not vote against party lines.</p>
<p>The MPAs, before they went in to cast their vote in the polling booth, received a ballot paper already marked, while leaving behind their own unmarked ballot paper, to be marked and polled by the next person. The practice was in blatant violation of the election rules and transparency, but not the first time such a procedure has been adopted. Both the treasury and opposition lawmakers followed the same process.</p>
<p>This is not the first time such a procedure has been adopted in the Senate election. During the tenure of Perviaz Khattak as the CM, the ruling PTI engaged in this practice, but not the opposition. Before that, the ANP would use covert tactics to keep its lawmakers in check. However, the way this practice had been deployed in Monday polls was unprecedented.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab by-poll</strong></p>
<p>In Punjab, PML-N leader Hafiz Abdul Kareem secured the vacant Senate seat in a by-election held to fill the seat left vacant after the death of Sajid Mir.</p>
<p>Out of 368 total votes, 345 were cast. Hafiz Abdul Kareem emerged victorious with 243 votes, while opposition candidate Mehr Abdul Sattar received 99 votes. Three votes were rejected.</p>
<p>Rana Muhammad Arshad, PML-N’s chief whip, highlighted the unity among government allied parties, stating that members fully adhered to their leadership’s directives.</p>
<p>Rana Arshad said that their 16 MPAs were abroad, so they could not use their right to franchise; otherwise, the ruling coalition’s vote tally would have been even better.</p>
