            <p><p>Israel’s military said Iran launched waves of missiles on Tuesday, with emergency services reporting four people killed, hours after US President Donald Trump announced a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">war</a>.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel.</p>
<p>Israel’s military said six waves of missiles were launched by Iran and Israel’s national ambulance service said four people were killed in Beersheba, the first reported deaths in Israel since Trump announced the ceasefire late on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump said on Tuesday a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was now in place and asked both countries not to violate it, only hours after Iran launched waves of missiles, which Israel’s ambulance service said killed four people.</p>
<p>“The ceasefire is now in effect. Please do not violate it!” he said in a Truth Social post.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior White House official said Trump had brokered a ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks.</p>
<p>“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” Trump <a class="link--external" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114734934153569653" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> on his Truth Social site.</p>

<p>An Iranian official earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, but the country’s foreign minister said there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.</p>
<p>Abbas Araqchi <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/1937311435882922420" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> early on Tuesday that if Israel stopped its “illegal aggression” against the Iranian people no later than 4am Tehran time (5:30am PKT) on Tuesday, Iran had no intention of continuing its response afterwards.</p>
<p>“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,” Araqchi added in a post on X.</p>

<p>Trump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would have some time to complete any missions that are underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process.</p>
<p>Iran’s semi-official <em>SNN</em> news agency reported on Tuesday that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.</p>
<p>Israel, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842">joined</a> by the United States on the weekend, has carried out <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899">attacks</a> on Iran’s nuclear facilities, after alleging Tehran was getting close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Iran <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1722538#:~:text=Iran%20has%20always%20denied%20any%20ambition%20to%20develop%20an%20atomic%20bomb">denies</a> ever having a nuclear weapons program but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to, world leaders “wouldn’t be able to stop us”.</p>
<p>Israel, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.</p>
<p>Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told <em>Reuters</em> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were in direct and indirect contact with the Iranians, a White House official said.</p>
<p>Neither Irans UN mission nor the Israeli embassy in Washington responded to separate requests for comment from <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p>Hours earlier, three Israeli officials had signaled Israel was looking to wrap up its campaign in Iran soon and had passed the message on to the United States.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had told government ministers whose discussions ended early on Tuesday not to speak publicly, Israel’s <em>Channel 12</em> television reported.</p>
<p>Markets reacted favourably to the news. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.4 per cent late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday.</p>
<p>US crude futures fell in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than a week after Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed, relieving worries of supply disruption in the region.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#end-to-the-fighting" id="end-to-the-fighting" title="Permalink"></a>End to the fighting?</h2>
<p>There did not appear to be calm yet in the region.</p>
<p>The Israeli military issued two evacuation warnings in less than two hours to residents of areas in the Iranian capital Tehran, one late on Monday and one early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israeli Army radio reported early on Tuesday that alarms were activated in the southern Golan Heights area due to fears of hostile aircraft intrusion.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump said he would encourage Israel to proceed towards peace after dismissing Iran’s attack on an American air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for the early notice of the strikes.</p>
<p>He said Iran fired 14 missiles at the US air base, calling it “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.</p>
<p>Iran’s handling of the attack recalled earlier clashes with the United States and Israel, with Tehran seeking a balance between saving face with a military response but without provoking a cycle of escalation it can’t afford.</p>
<p>Iran’s attack came after US bombers dropped 30,000-pound <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918842#:~:text=The%20US%20strikes%20included%2014%20bunker%2Dbuster%20bombs%2C%20more%20than%20two%20dozen%20submarine%2Dlaunched%20Tomahawk%20missiles%20and%20over%20125%20military%20aircraft%2C%20the%20top%20general%20added.">bunker-buster bombs</a> on Iranian underground nuclear facilities at the weekend, joining Israel’s air war.</p>
<p>Much of Tehran’s population of 10 million has fled after days of bombing.</p>
<p>The Trump administration maintains that its aim was solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, not to open a wider war.</p>
<p>“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on <em>Fox News</em>’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”</p>
<p>“Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,” Vance said.</p>
<p>Trump has cited intelligence reports that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, without elaborating.</p>
<p>However, US intelligence agencies said earlier this year they assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and a source with access to US intelligence reports told <em>Reuters</em> last week that that assessment hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>In a social media post on Sunday, Trump spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>Israel, however, had made clear that its strikes on Evin prison — a jail for housing political prisoners — and other targets in Tehran were intended to hit the Iranian ruling apparatus broadly, and its ability to sustain power.</p></p>

            <p><p>The US Supreme Court cleared the way on Monday for President Donald Trump’s administration to resume <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910913">deporting</a> migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harm they could face, handing him another victory in his aggressive pursuit of mass deportations.</p>
<p>In an action that prompted a sharp dissent from its three liberal justices, the court granted the administration’s request to lift a judicial order requiring that migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” get a “meaningful opportunity” to tell US officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out.</p>
<p>Boston-based US District Judge Brian Murphy had issued the order on April 18.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s brief order was unsigned and offered no reasoning, as is common when it decides emergency requests. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the two other liberal justices, called the decision a “gross abuse” of the court’s power.</p>
<p>“Apparently, the court finds the idea that thousands will suffer violence in far-flung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that a district court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the government to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally and statutorily entitled,” Sotomayor wrote.</p>
<p>Sotomayor called the court’s action “as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable.”</p>
<p>Murphy had found that the administration’s policy of “executing third-country removals without providing notice and a meaningful opportunity to present fear-based claims” likely violates the US Constitution’s due process protections. Due process generally requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking certain adverse actions.</p>
<p>After the Department of Homeland Security moved in February to step up rapid deportations to third countries, immigrant rights groups filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a group of migrants seeking to prevent their removal to such places without notice and to gain chance to assert the harms they could face.</p>
<p>Murphy on May 21 found the Trump administration violated his order requiring additional steps before attempting to send a group of migrants to politically unstable South Sudan, which the US State Department has urged Americans to avoid “due to crime, kidnapping and armed conflict.” The judge’s intervention prompted the US government to keep the migrants at a military base in Djibouti.</p>
<p>After the US Supreme Court ruling, Murphy in a court order made clear that his decision preventing the rapid deportation of eight men to South Sudan “remains in full force and effect.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which helps represent the plaintiffs, called the ramifications of the court’s action “horrifying,” stripping away “critical due process protections that have been protecting our class members from torture and death.”</p>
<p>The administration told the Supreme Court that its third-country policy already complied with due process and is critical for removing migrants who commit crimes because their countries of origin are often unwilling to take them back. It said that all the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902475">South Sudan-destined</a> migrants had committed “heinous crimes” in the United States, including murder, arson and armed robbery.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court’s stay of a left-wing district judge’s injunction reaffirms the president’s authority to remove criminal illegal aliens from our country and Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said after Monday’s decision.</p>
<p>“Fire up the deportation planes,” said Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.</p>
<h2><a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home#a-flood-of-cases" id="a-flood-of-cases" title="Permalink"></a>A flood of cases</h2>
<p>The dispute is one of many legal challenges to Trump policies to have reached the nation’s highest judicial body since he returned to office in January.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in May let Trump end <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891343">humanitarian programs</a> for hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the United States temporarily. The justices, however, faulted the administration’s treatment of some migrants whom Trump targeted for removal under the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898591/trump-admin-defies-court-deports-200-venezuelans#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20use%20of%20the%20Alien%20Enemies%20Act%E2%80%99s%20wartime%20powers%20to%20rapidly%20deport%20more%20than%20200%20alleged%20members%20of%20Tren%20de%20Aragua">Alien Enemies Act</a> — a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime — as inadequate under constitutional due process protections.</p>
<p>Sotomayor said that in sending migrants to South Sudan, and in another instance four others to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and on to El Salvador, the administration “openly flouted two court orders” issued by Murphy. Sotomayor also pointed to the separate Alien Enemies Act litigation in which questions were raised about the administration’s compliance with an order issued by a judge in that case.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote.</p>
<p>“Yet <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1914616">each time</a> this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”</p>
<p>The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals on May 16 declined to put Murphy’s decision on hold.</p>
<p><em>Reuters</em> has also reported that US officials had been considering sending migrants to Libya, another politically unstable country, despite previous US condemnation of Libya’s harsh treatment of detainees.</p></p>

            <p><p>• Tax on income derived from dividends raised to 29pc<br />
• 20pc tax proposed on profits from investments in government securities<br />
• FED of Rs10 imposed on one day-old chicks<br />
• No changes to voluntary pension regime; tax on pensions won’t apply to commutation &amp; gratuity amounts</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: As the government announced a modest tax relief for the lower income slabs, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday introduced three new tax measures in the National Assembly to offset its revenue impact — part of the country’s ongoing commitment to remain within the fiscal parameters agreed with the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915517">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF).</p>
<p>In his winding-up speech, Mr Aurangzeb informed the National Assembly that the proposed measures aim to offset the revenue shortfall resulting from the tax relief, while ensuring that the industrial and commercial sectors are not subjected to additional burden.</p>
<p>As part of three new revenue measures, the government has proposed raising the tax rate on income derived from the debt portion of dividends issued by mutual funds to companies — from 25 per cent to 29pc. The revision aligns this category with the tax rate already applied to other corporate income streams.</p>
<p>A 20pc tax has been proposed on profits earned by corporations and companies through investments in government securities — underscoring the government’s broader objective of expanding credit access for the private sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, a federal excise duty (FED) of Rs10 has been imposed on one-day-old chicks, aimed at ensuring the poultry industry contributes its due share to national revenue.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb stated that the government initially proposed reducing the tax rate from 5pc to 2.5pc for annual incomes between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million. However, following the prime minister’s directive, the rate was brought down to 1pc for this income bracket.</p>
<p>He also clarified a misperception stemming from his budget speech, where it was mistakenly inferred that the proposed tax on pensions would also apply to commutation and gratuity amounts. He said that that would not be the case. It was also clarified that there would be no changes in the taxation of voluntary pension scheme.</p>
<p>The minister said that the tax will only apply to individuals receiving annual pensions exceeding Rs10 million, while pensioners above the age of 75 are entirely exempt from any form of taxation.</p>
<p>He also informed the lower house that the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) powers related to tax fraud have been <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918913/budget-2025-26-curbs-placed-on-fbrs-arrest-powers-assures-aurangzeb">reassessed</a>, in line with proposed amendments in the Finance Bill.</p>
<p>Under the revised framework, tax fraud cases are now classified as either ‘cognisable’ or ‘non-cognisable’. For cases involving alleged tax fraud of up to Rs500m, the FBR will no longer be empowered to make arrests without a court-issued warrant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any arrest under this provision must meet at least one of the following criteria: the accused has deliberately failed to respond to three official notices; the individual has attempted to evade investigation; or there is evidence of record tampering.</p>
<p>The minister clarified that, even in such instances, arrest authorization will not rest with a single officer, rather must be approved by a three-member high-level committee within the FBR. Any individual taken into custody would have to be presented before a special judge within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also informed the National Assembly that the amount of sales tax proposed on solar power equipment had now been reduced to 10pc. However, he said, this tax will apply to only 46pc of imported components, resulting in a modest 4.6pc increase in the overall price of imported solar panels.</p>
<p>The original Finance Bill also proposed curbs on large asset purchases by undocumented individuals.</p>
<p>However, these restrictions will not apply to residential properties valued up to Rs50 million, commercial plots or properties up to Rs100 million, and vehicles priced up to Rs7 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, under existing law, capital gains tax will not be levied on the sale of property held for more than six years, provided the asset was acquired before July 1, 2024.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The minister said that such property will be subjected to 4.5-6pc withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally reimbursed upon filing returns. To give relief, property that was in personal use for 15 years or more would not be subject to this withholding tax.</p>
<p>The government has proposed levying a sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn, in a bid to narrow the price disparity between imported and locally produced goods, while bolstering the domestic agriculture sector.</p>
