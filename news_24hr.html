            <p><p>KARACHI: Four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in the Quaidabad area, police said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Special Investigation Unit of the Sindh police and an intelligence agency conducted the raid on a tip-off, SIU SSP Mohammed Shoaib Memon said, adding that they had links with the Indian intelligence agency — the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).</p>

<p>He identified the suspects as Mohammed Khan alias Gullu, Yameen Malah, Akhter Thaheem and Ghulam Qadir alias Akash, and claimed that they were found involved in espionage activities.</p>

<p>With their arrest, a plot to carry out terror attacks in the country was foiled, he said.</p>

<p>SSP Memon said that two hand grenades, a Kalashnikov, a rifle, two pistols and mobile phones were seized from them. The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.</p>

<p>“The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” the SIU officer claimed.</p>

<p>According to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.</p>

<p>They received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies’ personnel, the SSP said.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920169/american-investors-urged-to-explore-mineral-sector' target='_blank'><strong>American investors urged to explore mineral sector</strong></a>
            <p><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik on Wednesday urged American investors and companies to explore Pakistan’s vast mineral <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905497">wealth</a> through public-private partnerships and joint ventures.</p>
<p>Speaking at a webinar titled “Opportunities in Pakistan’s Mining Sector – Unlocking Mineral Potential”, the minister highlighted the country’s rich endowment of mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals vital for the global energy transition.</p>
<p>The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Energy and the US Embassy in Pakistan to promote investment opportunities in the country’s minerals and mining sector.</p>
<p>Mr Malik assured that both the Government of Pakistan and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are fully committed to facilitating international companies seeking to partner in unlocking Pakistan’s mineral reserves.</p>
<p>He emphasised Pakistan’s growing role in the global shift towards clean energy, citing the nation’s abundant reserves of critical minerals as a key enabler of a green transition. “Renewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,” he stated.</p>

<p>The minister underscored the international significance of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1900381">Reko Diq copper-gold project</a>, while also referencing recent discoveries in Balochistan’s Chaghi district and KP’s Waziristan region.</p>
<p>Mr Malik lauded the success of the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1902833">Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025</a> (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and global attention. “PMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,” he remarked.</p>
<p>US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker reaffirmed the strong economic ties between the US and Pakistan. “Pakistan offers immense opportunities in the minerals sector. With one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq, and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms Baker welcomed Pakistan’s recent policy initiatives aimed at unlocking the sector’s potential and pledged continued support from the US Embassy in facilitating American businesses. “We are here to foster connections and build win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan’s development, and we see great promise in this sector,” she added.</p>
<p>She concluded by reaffirming the US government’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s economic development and strengthening bilateral economic ties. “We believe in Pakistan’s potential and see shared opportunity in its journey toward inclusive, sustainable growth,” she said. The webinar was broadcast from the head office of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and brought together senior officials from the Ministry of Energy, leading mineral and energy firms, SIFC representatives, US diplomats, and energy sector stakeholders.</p>

            <a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920139/trump-praises-coas-again-for-averting-nuclear-war' target='_blank'><strong>Trump praises COAS again for averting nuclear war</strong></a>
            <p><p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1917868">credited</a> Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping prevent a nuclear <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509">conflict</a> with India, adding that he persuaded both sides to back down by linking peace to trade.</p>
<p>Explaining how he helped defuse tensions across the globe — from Ukr­­aine to Serbia — Trump said “the most impo­r­­tant” of these conflicts was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>“And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East, like we are talking about with Israel and Iran. This is — they have nuclear weapons,” President Trump said at his news conference in The Hague, at the conclusion of a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1920050/nato-summit-commits-to-higher-spending-and-collective-defence">Nato summit.</a></p>
<p>Referring to recent tensions between the two South Asian neighbours, Trump said, “I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, ‘Look, if you are going to be fighting each other…’ It was getting very bad — you know how bad that last attack was. It was very bad. If you are really going to go fighting with each other, we are not going to do any trade.’ They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal’.”</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>He described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He is a great gentleman. He is a great man. And I got them to reason. I said, ‘We are not doing any trade deal if you are going to be fighting. And if you are going to be fighting each other, we are not doing any trade deal’.”</p>
<p>Trump concluded, “And you know what? They said, ‘No, I want to do a trade deal.’ And we stopped the nuclear war.”</p>
<p>The remarks highlighted the key role played by Field Marshal Munir in easing regional tensions.</p>
<p>Although Trump did not name the general directly in his public remarks, he had earlier described Munir as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality.”</p>
<p>These statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1560322">acted</a> independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.</p>
<p>In broader comments during the Nato summit, Trump also said, “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.” While brief, the comment underscored Washington’s view of Pakistan as a key regional player, especially as the US explores reopening talks with Tehran.</p>
<p>Trump indicated negotiations with Iran could resume “as early as next week.”</p>
