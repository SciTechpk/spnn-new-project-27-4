            </a>
            <p><p>The bodies of nine bus passengers who were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923411/armed-men-kidnap-and-kill-nine-passengers-in-balochistan">kidnapped and killed</a> in Balochistan‚Äôs Sardhaka area last night were recovered and transported to their hometowns in Punjab on Friday morning, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan‚Äôs Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm¬≠issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.</p>
<p>Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that <em>Fitna-al-Hindu¬≠stan</em>  ‚Äî a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912930#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%98Fitna%20al%20Hindu%C2%ADstan%E2%80%99%20is%20a%20new%20phrase%20coined%20by%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20military%2C%20aimed%20at%20framing%20India%E2%80%99s%20alleged%20role%20in%20terrorism%20as%20a%20deliberate%20destabilisation%20strategy%2C%20potentially%20to%20galvanise%20domestic%20support.">term</a> the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo¬≠chistan ‚Äî had carried out attacks at three different places ‚Äî Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.</p>
<p>The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.</p>
<p>Alam told <em>Dawn.com</em> on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.</p>
<p>He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists must have taken the passengers‚Äô identification documents with them,‚Äù AC Alam said.</p>
<p>Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.</p>

<p>The country‚Äôs top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators ‚Äúat all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: ‚ÄúThis barbarity is part of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>‚Äôs evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,‚Äù state-run <em>Radio Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed commitment to ‚Äúclear the land of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> and its facilitators at all costs‚Äù.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: ‚ÄúWe will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.‚Äù</p>
<p>The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,‚Äù the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it ‚Äúblatant terrorism‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,‚Äù Bugti said, vowing that the response would be ‚Äúsevere‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,‚Äù he said, adding that the state ‚Äúwould not even let these murderers hide underground.‚Äù</p>
<p>The chief minister added: ‚ÄúAll networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of <em>Fitna-al-Hindustan</em> will be destroyed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noting that this was a ‚Äústate war‚Äù, he vowed decisive action.</p>
<p>CM Bugti further vowed to crush ‚Äúevery plan of terrorism‚Äù with strength, determination and unity. ‚ÄúBalochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab ‚Äî a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.</p>
<p>The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey dragged out 10 passengers ‚Äî seven from one coach and three from the other ‚Äî and took them away (to an unknown place),‚Äù a surviving passenger told Levies. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.‚Äù</p>
<p>After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.</p>
<p>Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.</p>
<p>According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.</p>

                <h2>Brother of actor Humaira Asghar denies media reports on family refusing to claim body</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The brother of the deceased model and actor Humaira Asghar Ali has criticised the media for reporting that the family refused to claim her body.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Humaira‚Äôs partially decomposed body was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922857/actor-and-model-humaira-asghar-ali-found-dead-in-karachis-dha">found</a> in her rented apartment in Karachi‚Äôs upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) when the police entered to enforce a court-ordered eviction.</p>
<p>Police on Wednesday <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923110">said</a> that she might have died around six months ago, citing the expiry date of food kept in the refrigerator and her phone records, which were both from  September 2024.</p>
<p>They also said that when approached, her family in Lahore ‚Äî particularly her father ‚Äî <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923110#:~:text=Family%20refuses%20to%20take%20body">refused</a> to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193842/celebrities-step-in-to-lay-humaira-asghar-ali-to-rest-after-her-family-refuses-to-claim-her-body">entertainment industry</a>. A day earlier, the brother Naveed Asghar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923361/elder-brother-keen-to-receive-actor-humairas-body-for-burial">arrived</a> in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial. Police had stated that the actor‚Äôs body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.</p>
<p>An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed today, seen by <em>Dawn.com</em>, confirmed that the body was in an ‚Äúadvanced stage of decomposition‚Äù and at least eight months old.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists last night, Naveed said, ‚ÄúThe body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police, including Station House Officer Farooq Ahmed Sanjrani of the Gizri Police.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  ">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--youtube  "></div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Naveed criticised the media for reporting that the family had refused to accept Humaira‚Äôs body, revealing that his parents were ‚Äúdistressed‚Äù due to the recent death of another close relative.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to the condition of the body, we could not carry it at that moment,‚Äù he said, adding that the police were carrying out legal procedures before the handover.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe media‚Äôs focus was entirely on our family. It never highlighted other possible causes of death,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Naveed acknowledged that his sister‚Äôs body was several months old, urging that the media should urge authorities to manage the installation of CCTV cameras in every house with a tenant.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>Naveed also said that Humaira was an ‚Äúindependent person‚Äù who wouldn‚Äôt visit the family for extended periods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe moved to Karachi and had been living here for the last seven years ‚Ä¶ she would visit home after several months or even a year at times,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt contact us for a year, although our mother had reached out to her asking about her whereabouts.‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued: ‚ÄúHer mobile phone had been switched off for the last six months, so our mother could not contact Humaira. We could not trace her number either.‚Äù</p>

<p>The reports suggesting Humaira‚Äôs family had refused to claim her body prompted the authorities and celebrities to come forward and take responsibility for her burial.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193844/sindh-culture-department-says-it-is-willing-to-take-responsibility-for-humaira-asghar-alis-burial?utm_source=www.dawn.com">Sindh culture department</a> offered to take care of Humaira‚Äôs burial and funeral if no relatives were willing to do so.</p>
<p>In a notification issued by the Sindh culture department on Thursday, Culture Minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah took notice of her death. He was ‚Äúvery much aggrieved for non-cooperation from her legal heirs to take over custody of the body for burial.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn light of this situation and considering her contributions to the arts and culture of the country, the culture department is willing to take responsibility for her burial arrangements with respect and in a dignified manner,‚Äù read the notice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several members of the entertainment fraternity also approached the police, <a href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1193842/celebrities-step-in-to-lay-humaira-asghar-ali-to-rest-after-her-family-refuses-to-claim-her-body?utm_source=www.dawn.com">expressing their willingness</a> to perform the last rites and arrange the burial. Actors Yashma Gill and Sonya Hussayn were among many who volunteered to take responsibility for arranging the burial.</p>
<p>The Actors Collective of Pakistan ‚Äî a trade body representing actors in the country ‚Äî had also announced that it will ensure she is ‚Äúlaid to rest with the dignity and respect every human being deserves‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn our family, no one is forgotten. No member is left behind. We stand together ‚Äî in life, in loss, and in remembrance,‚Äù the organisation wrote in a statement on Wednesday.</p></p>
