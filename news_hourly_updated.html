                <h2>UK lifts ban on Pakistani airlines, removes country from Air Safety List</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>The United Kingdom on Wednesday removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, thereby allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights to the UK, according to a statement from the British High Commission in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1566153">banned</a> from flying to the European Union, UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi‚Äôs Model Colony, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1558944">killing nearly 100 people</a>. The ban on operating to Europe was <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1875575">lifted</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs development comes after a team from the UK Department for Transport <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1923408/uk-audit-approves-pakistan-aviation-security">concluded</a> an aviation security ins¬≠pection at Islamabad Inter¬≠nat¬≠ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan‚Äôs security arrangements ‚Äúsatisfactory and in line with international standards‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFollowing air safety improvements, the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee has lifted UK restrictions on Pakistani carriers,‚Äù said a statement from the British High Commission.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIndividual airline carriers will still need to apply for permits to operate to the UK through the UK Civil Aviation Authority.‚Äù</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to aviation experts in the UK and Pakistan for their collaborative work to drive improvements to meet international safety standards.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.‚Äù</p>

<p>Decisions on de-listing states and air carriers from the UK Air Safety List are made through an independent aviation safety process, according to the statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is overseen by the UK‚Äôs Air Safety Committee, who have <em>[sic]</em> been closely engaging with the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority over several years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe committee has judged that necessary safety improvements have been made since its original decision in 2021. Therefore, based on this independent and technically-driven process, it has decided to remove Pakistan and its air carriers from the list.‚Äù</p>
<p>Reacting to today‚Äôs development, Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif commended the government led by his party for ‚Äúcrossing another milestone‚Äù. ‚ÄúThree years of continuous hard work have borne fruit,‚Äù he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/KhawajaMAsif/status/1945389259881406550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X.</p>

<p>He assailed ex-premier Imran Khan and then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar, who had said after the 2020 crash that almost <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1564911/initial-report-finds-human-error-on-part-of-pilots-atc-officials-in-pia-crash-aviation-minister#:~:text=%27Almost%2040pc%20pilots%20have%20fake%20licenses%27">40 per cent</a> of the country‚Äôs pilots had fake licenses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut today, the green crescent flag is once again soaring proudly in the skies,‚Äù Asif added, commending his aviation ministry for its efforts.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also hailed the move, saying that the move will provide ‚Äúease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith over 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the UK and thousands of British nationals in Pakistan, today‚Äôs announcement brings long-awaited relief and new opportunities for families and friends to reunite,‚Äù he wrote on X. ‚ÄúAs Pakistan‚Äôs third-largest trading partner, this ease in travel between the UK and Pakistan will help this vital trade relationship grow manifold.</p>

                <h2>2 cops shot dead by ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô in KP‚Äôs Dera Ismail Khan: police</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Two policemen were gunned down in a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù attack on Wednesday in Kulachi area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Dera Ismail Khan district, police said.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>Dawn.com</em>, DI Khan Police Spokesperson, Yaqoob Khan, said, ‚ÄúThe two police personnel were on their way to buy food when the terrorists opened fire on them.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deceased have been identified as head constable Ghulam Muhammad and constable Shahzad, both of whom were ex-servicemen.</p>
<p>Following the attack, police and Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel tracked down the terrorists and killed one of them during an operation, while the other two, though injured, fled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWeapons and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorist, while a search operation is underway for the terrorists at large,‚Äù according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack, paying tribute to the martyred personnel.</p>
<p>He saluted the ‚Äúsacrifices made by the brave sons‚Äù of KP in their fight against terrorism. Expressing sympathy for the families of the deceased, he said that the government stands with them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Naqvi vowed that ‚Äútheir sacrifices will not go in vain‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúKP police is leading the fight against terrorism in the country,‚Äù he noted.</p>
<p>Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1723647">ended</a> its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents, with a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1898473">series of attacks</a> across Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and Bajaur in the past few months.</p>
<p>On June 21, KP Police <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918714">killed</a> a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.</p>
<p>On June 3, terrorist <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1915202">attacks</a> on two police stations in KP‚Äôs Bajaur and Bannu districts injured four police personnel. In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911459">attack</a> in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1912410">lost</a> their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.</p>
<p>Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p>
<p>On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP‚Äôs Tipu Gul group were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1922269">killed</a> in a joint operation by the CTD.</p>
<p>Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p></p>
