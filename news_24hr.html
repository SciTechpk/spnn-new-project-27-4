            <p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with China’s President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states.</p>
<p>The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1864831">annual summit</a> of its leaders, which will be hosted <a class="link--external" href="https://www.chinadailyasia.com/hk/article/615887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by China</a> this autumn in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In a post on X today, Dar <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1945012596056187239" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>  he was “delighted” to meet with Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing before the SCO meeting and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.</p>
<p>“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.</p>

<p>The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1944974129993822435" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> (Mofa).</p>
<p>Shortly later, Dar <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/1944993236474384859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arrived in Tianjin</a> along with other foreign ministers to lead Pakistan’s delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting, according to Mofa.</p>

<p>The deputy premier arrived in Beijing last night, where he was received at the airport by Ambassador Yu Hong and other senior officials of the Asian Affairs department of China’s Mofa, as well as Pakistan’s ambassador to China, Khalil ur Rehman Hashmi.</p>
<p>India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and Iran’s Abbas Araghchi are among the top diplomats arriving in Beijing for the SCO moot.</p>

<p>Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.</p>
<p>“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1944996187607646493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.</p>

            <p><p>The United Kingdom’s government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.</p>
<p>The announcement came just a day after the two countries <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1924280/pakistan-uk-ink-accord-to-boost-economic-cooperation">formally signed</a> the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p>
<p>In a <a class="link--external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-evisas-for-pakistani-students-and-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a> today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: “The UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.”</p>
<p>British High Commissioner Jane Marriott <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/JaneMarriottUK/status/1945002473325752743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> on X that the facility was for “most students and workers applying for more than 6 months”.</p>

<p>An e-visa is an online record of a person’s immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.</p>
<p>“E-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,” it highlighted.</p>
<p>Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.</p>
<p>In 2024, the UK government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1854346">announced</a> that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.</p>
<p>The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students, including short-term study for 11 months</li>
<li>Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)  </li>
<li>Global Talent   </li>
<li>International Sportsperson   </li>
<li>Skilled Worker (including health and care)  </li>
<li>Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes) </li>
<li>Youth Mobility Scheme  </li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.</p>
<p>Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.</p>
<p>Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. “It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,” she pointed out.</p>
<p>    <figure class="media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven">
        <div class="media__item  media__item--newskitlink  ">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person’s present immigration status.</p>
<p>“Holders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The UKVI — introduced in 2024 — is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people’s immigration status.</p></p>

            <p><p>Five people — four from the same family — were killed in two separate road accidents in Karachi on Tuesday, according to rescue officials.</p>
<p>The city has lately <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891767">witnessed</a> a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.</p>
<p>At least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a nullah on the Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, according to DIG South Syed Asad Raza.</p>
<p>DIG South speculated that the family was most likely returning from Hawkesbay beach. The incident took place at 9am on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The accident most likely happened as a result of speeding,” said DIG South, adding that further investigation is underway.</p>
<p>The deceased include a man and woman — identified as Yousuf and Khalida — along with two children, 6-year-old Zainab  and 10-year-old Ayesha.</p>
<p>The injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital, three of whom are currently in critical condition, according to Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway, according to rescue officials.</p>
<p>The injured were rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, as per rescue officials.</p>
<p>The deceased has been identified as 39-year-old Gaya Chand, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1918288">killing</a> a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.  On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916541">hit</a> their bike on the Super Highway.</p>
<p>The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p></p>
