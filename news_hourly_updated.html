                <h2>Youm-i-Tashakur: Ceremony to celebrate Operation Bunyanum Marsoos underway in Islamabad</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>A ceremony to celebrate the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against India — a part of Marka-i-Haq — is being held in Islamabad on Friday at the Pakistan Monument to honour the armed forces and the nation.</p>
<p>The ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day), is attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, armed forces’ leadership, and other civil and military leaders. The day is being celebrated across the country today.</p>
<p>The event began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, opening speeches, a flypast, and national songs.</p>
<p>Beginning his speech, PM Shehbaz praised the martyrs, their families, his cabinet members, service chiefs, and the nation for successfully responding to the Indian aggression.</p>
<p>“A day such as today was seldom given to nations in world history,” he said. “The whole nation had been praying for the military against the enemy.”</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz said he had had a meeting with the services chiefs on the night between May 9 and 10, in which it was decided that since the enemy had crossed “the last limit” and rejected Pakistan’s offer of an international investigation, a “measured response” must be given.</p>
<p>He added that around 2:30am that night, the army chief had told him on a secure telephone call that India had launched its ballistic missiles on Pakistan.</p>
<p>“He told me, ‘Mr prime minister, grant us permission to strike the enemy with such force that they never forget it’”.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295/deaths-and-destruction-in-bahawalpur-muridke-after-indian-strikes">launched</a> a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded">stretched</a> over the week. It took <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1909993/pm-shehbaz-thanks-trumps-leadership-proactive-role-in-securing-full-immediate-ceasefire">American intervention</a> for both sides to finally drop their guns.</p>
<p>On Monday, the director general of military operations for both sides held the <a class="link--external" href="https://On%20Monday,%20the%20director%20general%20of%20military%20operations%20for%20both%20sides%20held%20the%20first%20round%20of%20talks%20via%20hotline%20after%20the%20ceasefire." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first round of talks</a> after the ceasefire.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Youm-i-Tashakur began with special prayers in mosques, followed by a <a class="link--external" href="https://x.com/GovtofPakistan/status/1923271405564469276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">31-gun salute</a> in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute at provincial capitals, according to <em>Radio Pakistan</em>.</p>
<p>The main ceremony of Youm-i-Tashakur was also held at the Pakistan Monument in Islamabad. PM Shehbaz was the chief guest at the ceremony, while the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief were also present there.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>In a statement, PM Shehbaz said that the brave and professional armed forces have written a “golden chapter” in military history by giving an effective and forceful response to the enemy and foiling the enemy’s intentions, state media  <em>Pakistan Television</em> <a class="link--external" href="https://ptv.com.pk/ptvnews/urdunewsdetail/6422" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. He added that innocent Pakistani citizens were martyred in this cowardly attack.</p>
<p>“In response to the enemy’s aggression, our falcons struck such effective blows that the enemy’s military bases, weapons depots and air bases were turned into ruins,” the premier continued.</p>
<p>He also praised the leadership of Chief of Army Staff General (COAS) Syed Asim Munir and paid tributes to Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and his falcons as well as the security of the maritime borders of the Pakistan Navy under the leadership of Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.</p>

                <h2>India should adhere to ceasefire, Pakistan will respond if hostilities resume: FO</h2>
            </a>
            <p><p>Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday urged India to maintain the ceasefire agreed with Pakistan, warning that the country would respond if the neighbour resumed aggression.</p>
<p>The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source">Pahalgam attack</a>.

<p>The nation observed <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911376/nation-observes-youm-i-tashakur-to-honour-armed-forces">Youm-i-Tashakur</a> across the country today to honour the armed forces and the people for the victory in <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1910381">Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</a> — a part of Marka-i-Haq — against India.</p>
<p>During his weekly press conference today, the spokesperson said: “The recent announcement of a Pakistan-India ceasefire is a positive development. We urge India to faithfully adhere to its implementation.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan appreciated the role of friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire and reiterated support for US President Donald Trump’s announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said the ceasefire was achieved by the role of several countries. “India’s portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of despair and frustration of Pakistan is baseless,” he added.</p>

<p>He informed that the military operations chiefs of both countries had maintained periodic contact since May 10 and both had agreed on a “structured mechanism for phased de-escalation”.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that Pakistan had also returned a constable of the Indian Border Security Force on Wednesday as a gesture of “goodwill” in return for a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers.</p>
<p>He said that at a time when the internal community was promoting regional peace and stability, “India’s rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan’s nuclear assets.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the spokesperson said that “Pakistan is a responsible state and remains committed to the ceasefire and taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”</p>
<p>He requested Pakistan’s international partners to ensure India honoured its commitments and refrained from further aggression due to its “belligerent posture”. “Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond,” he warned.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said Pakistan always believed in dialogue and the restoration of peace and wanted a solution to all issues, including occupied Kashmir, through negotiations.</p>

<p>Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and discussed regional developments, including the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Dar appreciated the UK’s constructive role in de-escalation.</p>
<p>The two also reviewed bilateral ties and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening relations and enhancing economic and trade cooperation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had a meeting with United States Acting Ambassador to Pakistan Natalie Baker that focused on key issues of mutual interest, bilateral relations, and expanding cooperation between the two countries, the <em>Associated Press of Pakistan</em> reported.</p>
<p>Both sides exchanged views on the post-ceasefire situation between Pakistan and India with Naqvi expressing gratitude to Trump and the American ambassador for their pivotal role in bringing about the ceasefire.</p>
<p>“The credit for the ceasefire between two nuclear powers goes to President Donald Trump,” he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that President Trump had rendered a great service to humanity by helping avert a catastrophic conflict in the region.</p>
<p>The interior minister also appreciated the US president’s positive remarks regarding Pakistan’s leadership.</p>
<p>“We welcome President Trump’s encouraging thoughts about Pakistan’s leadership,” Naqvi stated.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening ties with the US, Naqvi said, “We want to further enhance mutual cooperation with the US across various sectors”.</p>
<p>In response, Baker said the US valued its strong relationship with Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We have excellent ties with Pakistan and look forward to continuing cooperation in multiple fields,” she said.</p>
